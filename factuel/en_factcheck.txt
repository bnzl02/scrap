"Listen to the crowd CHEER as @RobertKennedyJr states that Bill Gates will have to go to trial in the Netherlands. 'He's been indicted in the Netherlands for lying to the public about the 'Covid Vaccine,'" says an October 24, 2024 X post from Liz Churchill, a self-described Canadian "conspiracy theorist" who has previously shared misinformation.
The post includes a clip of former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaking at an October 23 campaign event for Donald Trump in the US state of Georgia, during which he falsely claimed Dutch officials had indicted Gates.
Kennedy, whom President-elect Trump later nominated to serve as secretary of health and human services, also said Gates donated around $50 million to a group that backed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election to avoid similar charges in the United States.
The same claim has circulated elsewhere on X, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, YouTube, Rumble and Gettr.
Gates is frequently targeted by misinformation from anti-vaccine activists due to his vocal support for pandemic preparedness and the development of Covid-19 shots.
The latest claims are also false; Gates has not been found liable for anything related to vaccine safety in the Netherlands.
A keyword search revealed the claims stem from a case filed in civil court in Leeuwarden by seven Dutch citizens against 17 defendants -- including Gates, former prime minister Mark Rutte and the Dutch government.
The plaintiffs, whom local media describe as "a group of Corona skeptics," accuse Gates and the government of misleading them about the safety of Covid-19 vaccines and say they suffered physical and mental injury after they received the shot.
A spokesperson for the District Court of Northern Netherlands said the case is a private dispute.
"The case is not a criminal case, but a civil case, in which a number of plaintiffs have sued a number of other parties," the spokesperson said in an October 31 email.
Gates's attorneys challenged the suit because he does not live in the Netherlands, but the court found it has "international jurisdiction" to hear the case. The judge required Gates to pay 1,406 euros ($1,489) in legal fees as the losing party in the motion (archived here and here).
The case against Gates, which can at most result in damages for the plaintiffs, will be returned to the docket November 27.
Remme Verkerk, a law professor at Utrecht University (archived here), said that just because the court agreed to hear the case does not mean it has merit.
"You are allowed to start proceedings, and then the main rule in our legal system is that anyone may go to court," he said November 1.
Some posts claim Gates may be "extradited" to the Netherlands or compelled to "stand trial" there. However, Verkerk said Gates would likely not have to appear in court.
"I really don't see them issuing an order for Mr. Gates to necessarily be here. That's not how it works in civil cases," he said.
"There's no police van coming by to pick someone up for the hearing."
The District Court of Northern Netherlands spokesperson confirmed Gates does not have to attend court hearings in the country and can be represented by his attorney.
The complaint also accuses Gates and his co-defendants of endorsing the "Great Reset agenda."
In June 2020, the World Economic Forum launched an initiative calling for a "Great Reset" and pushing countries to achieve the United Nations's sustainable development goals defined in Agenda 2030 (archived here and here).
Online, the move triggered a conspiracy theory that falsely accuses the global institutions of starting or using the Covid-19 pandemic as cover for plots to impose radical authoritarian policies.
Kennedy has also amplified false claims about the Great Reset on his social media channels.
AFP contacted Kennedy's presidential campaign for comment, but no response was forthcoming.

"What happens when a protest for Palestine goes past the set filming for the new film of Peaky Blinders? Cillian Murphy does this...." says a November 14, 2024 post sharing the clip on both Facebook and X.
Similar posts on X have shared the video with messages such as: "The Peaky Blinders stand with Palestine!"
In the 18-second clip, a man waves a Palestinian flag and runs along a street while wearing an outfit reminiscent of gangster Tommy Shelby, Murphy's character in the six-season saga about a fictional British crime family.
Murphy, who more recently starred in the title role of the 2023 blockbuster "Oppenheimer," is reprising the Shelby role for the new movie -- which is already in production, according to a November 1 release from Netflix (archived here).
However, the Irish actor is not the man brandishing the Palestinian flag in the video circulating online.
Reverse image searches surfaced matching footage on TikTok as early as October 14 (archived here). Hashtags in the TikTok post's caption identify the man as Derek Liam Brennan and indicate the footage was recorded near the Big Bulls Head, a pub in Birmingham, England, on October 13 (archived here).
Brennan, from Birmingham, is an administrator for a Facebook group where fans of "Peaky Blinders" post about the acclaimed show and plan meet-ups (archived here). A Facebook event shows he organized an October 13 gathering for group members at the Big Bulls Head, their usual meeting place (archived here).
The same day, an activist group called Birmingham Palestine Action hosted a march along a route that took them past the Big Bulls Head (archived here and here). Hundreds attended, according to local media (archived here).
The TikTok user who posted the original footage told AFP in a November 18 message that they filmed it from the protest and that it shows Brennan, not Murphy.
Another video Brennan posted from his "Peaky Blinders" event shows him and fellow fans sporting the same outfits as those in the clip circulating online (archived here).
Brennan told AFP in an Instagram direct message that the posts circulating online are "wrong."
He said he carried the banner as the pro-Palestinian march was underway in the same area but that he was not part of the protest.
"It's all a joke," he said November 18. "We was nothing to do with the march. We are fans of the show that is all."
He added: "I don't get involved in politics."
In a pair of follow-up posts on X, the user who first claimed Murphy was holding the flag later corrected the record and identified the man as Brennan.
Murphy dedicated an Oscar award he won in March for his "Oppenheimer" performance to "peacemakers everywhere" but did not reference the war in Gaza directly.
AFP contacted representatives for Murphy for comment, but no response was forthcoming.

“The power of a state governor. As Nyesom Wike collaborated with the court in Abuja to stop River state allocations. In return, Governor Sim Fubara of River state shuts down NNPC and all oil companies in Rivers state, declares no allocation for Rivers state, no oil for Nigeria (sic),” wrote an X user on October 31, 2024.
Shared more than 600 times, the post also claims Nigeria dropped in the global oil production ranking from 4th to 24th within minutes of the purported order.
The claim has also appeared on Facebook here and here.
Siminalayi Fubara was elected governor of the oil-rich Rivers state in March 2023. He succeeded Nyesom Wike, a lawyer who has now been appointed as minister in charge of Nigeria’s capital city, Abuja, by President Bola Tinubu.
Shortly after his inauguration, Wike and Fubara became embroiled in a battle over control of the state (archived here).
The tussle resulted in a failed impeachment attempt and a dispute among state legislators who sued Fubara for breaching constitutional requirements by presenting the annual budget to a four-member legislature rather than a fully constituted parliament (archived here).
Ruling in favour of the lawmakers, a judge in the federal high court in Abuja ordered the state’s accounts to be frozen and allocations to the state withheld (archived here).
The judgement is on appeal (archived here).
The Rivers state government denied shutting down the facilities of oil companies (archived here).
“The report was not only false but concocted propaganda from the imagination of the author and enemies of the state,” read a statement signed by Joseph Johnson, the state’s commissioner for information and communication, and sent to Nigerian media outlets.
“We, therefore, enjoin Rivers people and well-meaning Nigerians to discountenance the spurious and fake report as Governor Fubara at no time contemplated and/or directed such needless order of shutting down the economy for any reason.”
Nelson Chukwudi, the chief press secretary to the Rivers state governor, also told AFP Fact Check that oil companies were carrying out their operations undisturbed.
Evidence of this lies in the data.
Nigeria is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), an association of oil-exporting countries that ensures stable prices and supply in the global crude oil market.
OPEC publishes a monthly report on the oil market. The November edition contains data on the quantity of crude oil produced by OPEC member countries and partners in October 2024.
According to OPEC, Nigeria produced an average of 1.33 million barrels of crude oil daily in October 2024.
This is an increase of 9,000 barrels from the 1.32 million barrels produced in September 2024.
Adewale Dosunmu, a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Port Harcourt in the Rivers state capital, said an increase in production would not be possible if oil exploration facilities had been shut down.
“Rivers state is a major hub for oil exploration activities in Nigeria. A disruption would have negatively impacted Nigeria’s oil output for October. It would have also made global news given that many international oil companies operate in Rivers state including Chevron, Shell and domestic ones like Oando and Seplat,” he told AFP Fact Check.
The claim that Nigeria ranked fourth in global oil production and then dropped to 24th is also false.
Data from the US Energy Information Administration showed that the average daily production of the world’s top 10 crude oil producers ranged from 21.9 million barrels per day to 2.9 million barrels per day in 2023 (archived here).
According to OPEC data, Nigeria’s average daily crude oil production was 1.3 million barrels per day – far less than the top 10 biggest producers globally.
OPEC has a declaration of cooperation with 22 countries, including 12 member countries to regulate crude oil supply to the global market.
Other oil-producing countries including the US, Canada, Brazil and Angola are not a part of the agreement.
Based on October production numbers, Nigeria was the eighth-largest crude oil producer among OPEC members and partner countries.
This is slightly higher compared to September when Nigeria was ranked ninth.

“Hezbollah attacks a petrochemical plant south of Haifa. Haifa is within Hezbollah rocket as a legitimate military target for the displaced Palestinians in the North (sic),” reads a Facebook post published on October 28, 2024.
In the video, a huge fireball burns in the distance while the sound of explosions is heard.
According to the date on the reel, the clip was posted a day after Hezbollah said it had fired rockets at northern Israel after declaring several areas in the region a “legitimate target” because of the presence of Israeli troops (archived here).
The Iran-backed Lebanese group said it targeted a “military industries base north of Haifa... with a large rocket salvo”.
Israel has escalated its bombing of Lebanon since September 23, 2024, and sent in ground troops, following almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges of fire.
The claim also appeared on Facebook and X in English while the Arabic version was debunked by AFP Fact Check.
However, the claim about the video is false.
Using the InVID-WeVerify tool, we extracted keyframes from the clip and conducted reverse image searches.
One of the results led to a Facebook video published by Turkish public broadcaster TRT World on September 29, 2024 (archived here).
The video caption described how the Israeli army had carried out “air strikes on fuel tanks in the Huthi-controlled port city of Hudaida in Yemen (sic)”.
Using Google Earth, AFP Fact Check confirmed the video was taken in Hudaydah by matching the distinct pyramid-shaped structure at a roundabout in the foreground of the video.
Hudaydah is a key entry point for fuel and humanitarian aid to war-ravaged Yemen.
On September 29, 2024, the Israeli military launched airstrikes on two ports and two power stations in the Huthi-controlled western Yemeni province of Hudaydah  (archived here).
The bombings killed four people and injured 33 others, according to the rebel-affiliated Al Masirah TV.
Yemeni rebels have launched several attacks on Israel since the start of Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip following Hamas' unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.
The Huthi rebels regularly attack ships they say are linked to Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

"How come the current president was not invited?" read the caption of a TikTok post from November 9 that racked up 1.2 million views.
It showed two newspaper headlines that read: "Donald Trump invites Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to White House" and "The story behind Donald Trump and Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's populist bromance".
Text at the bottom of the video claimed Trump invited the ex-president to his inauguration on January 20, 2025.
The Duterte and Marcos families have been locked in a bitter feud ahead of the mid-term elections in 2025 and presidential polls in 2028 (archived link).
Duterte had accused Marcos of being a "drug addict", with the president hitting back and claiming his predecessor's health was failing due to long-term use of the powerful opioid fentanyl.
Neither provided evidence of their allegations.
Comments on the post -- which spread across TikTok here and here and also Facebook --  appear to show Duterte's supporters believing the claim.
"What a big insult to the current president! Long live our beloved [Duterte], a one-of-a-kind leader," one wrote.
"I think they're best friends," said another.
However, the headlines shared in the social media posts were published long before Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election.
An online search for the news headlines revealed that both articles were published in 2017.
"The story behind Donald Trump and Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's populist bromance," was published by Quartz on May 2, 2017 (archived link).
"Donald Trump invites Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to White House" was taken from a Straits Times article from April 30, 2017. The false social media posts altered the headline, erasing the words "in phone call" at the end (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison of the headlines in the false posts (left) and the original (centre, right), with the publishing date and omitted words highlighted:
The reports detailed the relations between Trump and Duterte after the White House issued a statement on April 29, 2017 on a "friendly conversation" between the two leaders (archived links here and here).
"President Trump also invited President Duterte to the White House to discuss the importance of the United States-Philippines alliance, which is now heading in a very positive direction," the last part of the statement read.
Despite Trump's invitation, Duterte did not visit the White House during his term and vowed never to set foot in "lousy" America (archived link).
Furthermore, AFP found no reports about Philippine officials being invited to Trump's inauguration, as of November 16.
Local news outlet GMA News Online quoted the Philippine ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez on November 7 as saying: "We don't know if Trump's transition team will be inviting foreign leaders to the inauguration" (archived link).
Serving Philippine presidents have not typically attended US presidential inaugurations in the past (archived link).

"Mr. Trudeau -- if elected again in Canada -- I personally will have him arrested if he steps one foot in the United States," Trump supposedly says in the voiceover of a November 5, 2024 TikTok.
Other posts on the video-sharing platform spread the same audio over different screenshots of the two North American politicians, garnering millions of views.
Trump won the US presidential election on November 5 and Trudeau offered congratulations to the president-elect, highlighting the countries' "successful partnership" as neighbors and active trade partners (archived here).
The two leaders did share tense exchanges during Trump's first presidency with Trudeau later launching veiled jabs of the American's rhetoric, but the audio of Trump discussing a possible arrest appears to be a manipulation.
Using keyword searches, AFP could not find other media or official statements referencing a supposed threat from Trump (archived here). Two publicly available artificial speech detectors found the audio was very likely a deepfake (archived here) created with speech synthesis software such as a product from the AI firm ElevenLabs.
Hélène Huang, a former research assistant at Concordia University's Applied AI Institute, said she received similar results when running the clip through a detector.
"Of course, the tools are not always a hundred percent reliable, but when they flag it as possibly AI-generated, it usually means that the inputs are very likely fishy," she said in a November 15, 2024 email.
Huang pointed out the audio sounded robotic and ended abruptly -- characteristics she said the Applied AI Institute elections research team found in other manipulated audio (archived here).
Both Trump and Trudeau have been subjects of deepfakes debunked by AFP.
Aleksander Essex, an associate professor of software engineering at the University of Western Ontario (archived here), listened to the clip and noted that the audio had the same quality -- or timbre -- as Trump's voice, but that the rhythm was stilted. He said the robotic-sounding voice suggested the audio was manipulated given that it differs from Trump's typical speech patterns.
"Donald Trump is not generally known for speaking in a monotone voice, it comes off as non-characteristic," Essex said in a November 15 interview.
He agreed with Huang that AI detector tools are not completely reliable, adding that as the technology evolves, deepfakes will become almost indistinguishable from legitimate media. A better way to verify manipulated audio and video, Essex said, would be to assess the veracity of what is being claimed in a potential deepfake.
"The content of what he is saying is kind of ridiculous and extraordinary," Essex said, speaking about the idea of arresting the prime minister. "So that is another red flag."
No Canadian or American head-of-state has ever been arrested while visiting the neighboring country.
According to the Institute of International Law in Geneva, serving heads of governments may not be placed under arrest while visiting a foreign state (archived here). This international immunity is less legally definite if the head-of-state is accused in a war crimes or genocide case.
Rights groups have sought to implicate Trudeau and other members of his cabinet in a war crimes case related to the conflict in Gaza (archived here), but Canada's prime minister has not been charged in any such court proceeding.
AFP has also debunked false claims of genocide convictions levied against Trudeau.

The claim also appeared on Facebook and X in English while the Arabic version was debunked by AFP Fact Check.
However, the claim about the video is false.
Using the InVID-WeVerify tool, we extracted keyframes from the clip and conducted reverse image searches.
One of the results led to a Facebook video published by Turkish public broadcaster TRT World on September 29, 2024 (archived here).
The video caption described how the Israeli army had carried out “air strikes on fuel tanks in the Huthi-controlled port city of Hudaida in Yemen (sic)”.
Using Google Earth, AFP Fact Check confirmed the video was taken in Hudaydah by matching the distinct pyramid-shaped structure at a roundabout in the foreground of the video.
Hudaydah is a key entry point for fuel and humanitarian aid to war-ravaged Yemen.
On September 29, 2024, the Israeli military launched airstrikes on two ports and two power stations in the Huthi-controlled western Yemeni province of Hudaydah  (archived here).
The bombings killed four people and injured 33 others, according to the rebel-affiliated Al Masirah TV.
Yemeni rebels have launched several attacks on Israel since the start of Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip following Hamas' unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.
The Huthi rebels regularly attack ships they say are linked to Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

"How come the current president was not invited?" read the caption of a TikTok post from November 9 that racked up 1.2 million views.
It showed two newspaper headlines that read: "Donald Trump invites Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to White House" and "The story behind Donald Trump and Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's populist bromance".
Text at the bottom of the video claimed Trump invited the ex-president to his inauguration on January 20, 2025.
The Duterte and Marcos families have been locked in a bitter feud ahead of the mid-term elections in 2025 and presidential polls in 2028 (archived link).
Duterte had accused Marcos of being a "drug addict", with the president hitting back and claiming his predecessor's health was failing due to long-term use of the powerful opioid fentanyl.
Neither provided evidence of their allegations.
Comments on the post -- which spread across TikTok here and here and also Facebook --  appear to show Duterte's supporters believing the claim.
"What a big insult to the current president! Long live our beloved [Duterte], a one-of-a-kind leader," one wrote.
"I think they're best friends," said another.
However, the headlines shared in the social media posts were published long before Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election.
An online search for the news headlines revealed that both articles were published in 2017.
"The story behind Donald Trump and Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's populist bromance," was published by Quartz on May 2, 2017 (archived link).
"Donald Trump invites Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to White House" was taken from a Straits Times article from April 30, 2017. The false social media posts altered the headline, erasing the words "in phone call" at the end (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison of the headlines in the false posts (left) and the original (centre, right), with the publishing date and omitted words highlighted:
The reports detailed the relations between Trump and Duterte after the White House issued a statement on April 29, 2017 on a "friendly conversation" between the two leaders (archived links here and here).
"President Trump also invited President Duterte to the White House to discuss the importance of the United States-Philippines alliance, which is now heading in a very positive direction," the last part of the statement read.
Despite Trump's invitation, Duterte did not visit the White House during his term and vowed never to set foot in "lousy" America (archived link).
Furthermore, AFP found no reports about Philippine officials being invited to Trump's inauguration, as of November 16.
Local news outlet GMA News Online quoted the Philippine ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez on November 7 as saying: "We don't know if Trump's transition team will be inviting foreign leaders to the inauguration" (archived link).
Serving Philippine presidents have not typically attended US presidential inaugurations in the past (archived link).

Parliament appointing a special prosecutor "does not violate the separation of powers," Kim Hae-won, a constitutional law professor at Pusan National University Law School, told AFP (archived link).
"Theoretically I think it's as clear as one plus one equals two," Kim said.
President Yoon earlier slammed a bill backed by the opposition Democratic Party (DP) which sought to name a special prosecutor to probe the country's first lady Kim Keon Hee over allegations of stock manipulation and meddling in party and state affairs.
During a press conference on November 7, 2024, Yoon defended his wife and said the power to initiate investigations and assign prosecutors "are inherent functions of the executive branch."
"There is no country in the world where the decision to conduct a special prosecutor investigation is made by the legislature," he said. "This clearly violates the separation of powers in liberal democracies."
He went on to say it ran "counter to the constitution" to appoint a special prosecutor opposed by the president and the ruling party.
Law professor Kim told AFP: "Our constitution does not prohibit establishing independent administrative agencies outside the president's purview."
He added no branches of the government "monopolise their respective powers entirely".
"If we follow the president's reasoning, then even the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) would be unconstitutional," Kim said referring to an independent anti-graft agency that he said has executive functions.
Kim also said the legality of special prosecutors has been consistently upheld.
Such prosecutors are nominated by the National Assembly and appointed by the president to investigate cases seen to be vulnerable to political interference (archived link).
The Constitutional Court in Seoul ruled in 2019 that whether to conduct a special prosecutor investigation for a particular case is a "matter for the National Assembly to decide" (archived link).
Son In-hyuk, a constitutional law professor at Yonsei University Law School in Seoul, said the court arrived at the verdict at the time "specifically because the special prosecutor system is intended for investigating contentious cases" involving conflicts of interest (archived link).
Both experts also refuted Yoon's remarks that it was unconstitutional for parliament to appoint a special prosecutor who is "opposed by the president and the ruling party".
Kim said the constitution requires a majority vote for decisions made in the legislature with provisions for specific majorities if needed.
"Legally, what matters isn't whether the opposing parties reached an agreement but whether the law was enacted properly according to the procedures set out in the constitution," he said.
He further dismissed the claim as lacking merit. "Let's say there was only one lawmaker from the ruling party sitting in the legislature, would they still argue the law should be rejected simply because that one person opposes it?"
This was also upheld in the Constitutional Court ruling in 2019, which deemed it "reasonable" and "legitimate" to exclude the ruling party from the candidate nomination process.
Son agreed bipartisan consensus is legally irrelevant. "I find it unconvincing to argue the constitutionality of a matter based on whether such an agreement exists," he said.
Multiple news reports showed special prosecutor investigations previously proceeded without bipartisan agreement including a 2003 probe into allegations of South Korea's spy agency paying North Korea for a summit meeting and a 2012 probe involving then President Lee Myung-bak's son (archived links here, here, here and here).
Following his remarks, Yoon's critics pointed out he played key roles in high-profile special counsel probes as a prosecutor, including in the corruption scandal that brought down his predecessor Park Geun-hye (archived link).
Multiple social media posts -- including here, here and here on X -- also claimed "special prosecutor investigations are unconstitutional" and attributed the message to the president.
Yoon has been stuck with low approval ratings for months, amid allegations that he granted a personal favour to a self-proclaimed "power broker" that helped the president in his election victory (archived link).
His wife Kim had been under scrutiny for her alleged role in a stock manipulation scheme.
South Korean media reported that prosecutors dropped charges against Kim after deciding she was not aware that several of her bank accounts were used in a pump-and-dump scheme involving Deutsch Motors -- a dealer for BMW cars in South Korea -- between 2009 and 2012 (archived link).
However, opposition lawmakers continued to pursue a bill to look into her alleged role in the scheme, along with separate allegations that she meddled in the conservative ruling People Power Party's candidate nomination process in the lead-up to recent elections, including a 2022 by-election, and state affairs (archived link).
South Korea's National Assembly adopted a bill on November 14, 2024 seeking to appoint a special prosecutor to probe Kim (archived link).
Analysts widely expect President Yoon to veto the bill and send it back for a revote.

"Harris's momentum was over and she freaked out at the rally. She couldn't laugh anymore," read a simplified Chinese X post shared on November 7, 2024.
In the video, Harris yells and gestures to a crowd, who can be heard chanting: "We're not going back."
The same video was shared alongside similar claims on Weibo and TikTok as results began to show Trump leading over Harris in the US elections on November 5 (archived link).
"Who wouldn't be mad about losing like this?" read one user comment, suggesting they believed the video showed Harris on election night.
"The look on her face tells you the election situation," another wrote.
Trump later went on to claim a "magnificent" victory over the vice president before the final results were in (archived link).
The win gives him almost complete control over the levers of US government now that Republicans have added the House of Representatives to their White House and Senate victories (archived link).
On November 7, Harris gave a defiant concession speech in Washington after Trump's stunning win and told tearful supporters in Washington to "not despair" and urging them to "keep fighting" after her loss (archived links here and here).
Her pledge to ensure a peaceful handover stood in stark contrast with Republican Trump's unprecedented refusal four years ago to admit defeat against Joe Biden, culminating in a violent attack by his supporters on the US Capitol.
The circulating video actually shows Harris at a campaign rally in October 2024, before the election.
AFP found the clip was taken at an October 25, 2024 election rally, by comparing Harris' outfit and a backdrop with "Freedom" written on it to videos from previous events.
ABC-affiliated television station WFAA published footage from the event, with the clip shared online starting at the four-minute, 58-second timestamp (archived link).
Harris's speech was interrupted at one point when the crowd chanted "we're not going back", as shown in the WFAA video and in a transcript published by the White House (archived link).
Eleven days before the final vote, Harris was banking on her star-studded show -- which featured superstar Beyoncé and 91-year-old country legend Willie Nelson -- to bring abortion to the forefront of voters' minds (archived link).
"We are 11 days out from an election that will decide the future of America, including the freedom of every woman to make decisions about her own body and her reproductive freedom," she said after her speech was interrupted.
"And moving forward, we understand that what we must do, Texas, is right here, you, who are ground zero in the fight for reproductive freedom, we must be loud.
"Texas is home to one of the most restrictive abortion bans in our country."
Trump eventually won the Texas contest and 40 electoral votes, with a reportedly historic margin of over one million votes (archived links here and here).

"Mood of Maharashtra. Maharashtra election campaign started in a very beautiful manner," read a Facebook post written in a mix of English and Hindi shared on November 7, 2024.
It included a video that shows people in a high-rise building standing on their balconies chanting "Jai Shri Ram" -- a popular religious chant among India's Hindu-majority population (archived link).
The two-minute and 29-second video was shared with the false claim elsewhere on Facebook here and on social media site X.
The posts surfaced ahead of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election set on November 20, where the opposition bloc that includes the Indian National Congress party -- accused by critics of being overly favourable to the Muslim minority -- hopes to unseat the state's ruling coalition led by BJP (archived link).
However, the video in the false posts was not filmed in the state.
A reverse image search of keyframes on Google found the video was published on Facebook on February 15, 2022. Its caption said the video was filmed in Kanpur city in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state (archived link).
A video showing the same scene was also shared on Facebook on February 12, 2022 (archived link).
The post said the clip shows the right-wing Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) conducting a "prabhat pheri" -- a ritual of processions in the morning while reciting religious text -- in several apartment complexes in Kanpur.
The caption also said it was filmed in an apartment complex called Diviniti Homes.
Below is a screenshot comparison of the video as seen in the false posts (left) and in the 2022 post (right):
AFP was able to confirm the location of the video by comparing it with Google Street View imagery of the Diviniti Homes apartment complex (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison of the video (left) and its corresponding location on Google Maps (right) with similar elements highlighted:
The claim was previously debunked by the Indian fact-checking website Newschecker.

"Huthi spokesman: Our operations in international waters were defensive only and we announce their final cessation," says a November 6, 2024 X post in Arabic.
Similar claims gained traction in English across platforms such as Threads, Instagram and Facebook -- usually accompanied by images of what appear to be a press conference held by a Yemeni army officer.
But the claims are false.
A reverse image search indicates the officer in the image shared on social media is Yahya Saree, a Huthi military spokesman (archived here). The picture appears to stem from a 2023 press conference (archived here).
AFP has previously debunked claims about the Huthis using the same image.
Huthi rebels have maintained their attacks in international waters since Trump won the 2024 US presidential election -- and the group's leader has confirmed the outcome will not change its military strategy.
The Huthis unsuccessfully targeted two US warships with drones and missiles in the Red Sea on November 12. The group has targeted vessels navigating international waters since November 2023 in attacks they claim are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
Huthi leader Abdul Malik al-Huthi said November 7, 2024 that Trump's reelection would not affect the rebels' operations against Israel and its allies' shipping activities, adding that the group will continue to target US vessels transiting the Red Sea (archived here).
Huthi also criticized Trump for supporting Israel. He said Trump-brokered deals between Arab countries and Israel had failed to bring an end to conflict in the Middle East and that he would fail again in his second term.
Trump leads a fiercely pro-Israel Republican Party and has named an ambassador to Israel who opposes the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state. The Biden-Harris administration has said it supports a two-state solution but also drew criticism from the left of the Democratic Party for backing Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza.

“Expert confirms SouthEast is closer to the sea than Lagos but Nigeria chose to spend more in building seaport in faraway Lagos than Southeast. That’s marginalization against the Igbos (sic),” read an X post shared more than 1,000 times since it was published on October 3, 2024.
Igbo is a tribe mainly based in southeastern Nigeria (archived here), where a secessionist movement known as the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has been pushing for regional independence over claims of marginalisation and resource control.
Disinformation linked to the ports is part of a wider debate centred on the issue of restructuring, which refers to the redistribution of power between the federal and state governments. The topic has long been a point of contention in Nigeria.
The post includes two images of what appear to be screenshots of an internet search on the distance between seaports in Nigeria and the Atlantic Ocean.
The first screenshot claims the distance between the slated Obeaku Ndoki Port in Abia state and the Atlantic Ocean is 46 kilometres (25 nautical miles).
The second alleges the distance between an “almighty” seaport in Lagos and the Atlantic Ocean is 111 kilometres (60 nautical miles). It also suggested that a “potential” Oseakwa seaport would be 33 kilometres (18 nautical miles) from the Atlantic Ocean. Cultural stakeholders and lawmakers from the southeastern region argue that the creation of a port in Oseakwa would boost the region's economy (archived here).
The claim was shared by other X accounts and on Facebook in October 2024.
Research showed it already circulated more than a year ago when it spread across social media, including here, here and here. Paschal Agbodike, a federal MP from Anambra state, also made the assertion during a legislative hearing in 2023 (archived here).
When we ran the query through Gemini AI – Google's generative artificial intelligence tool that uses large language models to answer questions – it also claimed that ports in Nigeria’s southeast, such as the slated Obeaku Ndoki port, would be closer to the Atlantic Ocean than the ports in Lagos.
Perplexity.ai came up with the same result.
However, AFP Fact Check found that these statements were false.
Nigeria borders the Gulf of Guinea – the northeasternmost part of the Atlantic Ocean – with an 853 km-long coastline (archived here).
States in Nigeria’s south and southwest are situated along the boundary of the Atlantic Ocean. These include Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Delta, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Rivers (archived here).
Lagos, Nigeria’s maritime hub, has three seaports: Lekki, Apapa and Tincan Island.
Lekki is the newest in the state, having opened for operations in 2023.
Apapa was established in 1913, making it Nigeria's oldest port, while Tincan Island Port was launched in 1977. Both are situated in Apapa and jointly handled 85 percent of Nigeria’s total imports in the fourth quarter of 2023 (archived here).
The distance from the Apapa Port to the Atlantic Ocean is 7.68 km (4.15 nautical miles).
Tincan Island is located 11.67 km (6.3 nautical miles) from the Atlantic Ocean.
The newly constructed Lekki Deep Sea Port is the one closest to the Atlantic Ocean in Lagos, with a distance of 3.42 km (1.85 nautical miles).
Using the measurement tool on Google Earth, AFP Fact Check found that the distance between the proposed location of the Obeaku Ndoki Port and the Atlantic Ocean is 51.53km (27.82 nautical miles) – far more than the distance between the Lagos ports and the ocean.
The distance was measured along the length of the river from the confluence of the Obeaku Ndoki River and the Azumini River to the Atlantic Ocean.
This confluence is the proposed location of the port approved for construction in 2020 (archived here).
Experts confirmed that the claims were false.
“People argue that southeastern Nigeria is not landlocked because rivers flow into one another and ultimately empties into the Atlantic Ocean,” said Kenneth Nnadi, a maritime management technology professor at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri in southeastern Nigeria.
“However, it is geographically incorrect to say the proposed ports in southeast Nigeria are closer to the Atlantic Ocean than those in Lagos. Lagos state directly borders the Atlantic,” he told AFP Fact Check.
According to reports, the suggested Oseakwa seaport would be along the Oseakwa River, in Ihiala local government area of Anambra state.
Nnadi said colonial powers once used the river to transport items for export.
AFP Fact Check compared satellite imagery from Google Earth to videos showing the location of the suggested Oseakwa seaport.
A bridge can be seen in the background of a video showing the suggested spot. An abandoned building with a brown roof can be seen at the 4’42” mark.
The distance from the bridge over the Oseakwa River to the Atlantic Ocean measured 287.53km (155.26 nautical miles). The river is linked to the Atlantic Ocean using connecting water bodies in three states: Imo, Bayelsa and Rivers.
Again, this is far more than the distance between Lagos’ ports and the ocean.
Nnadi said the decision to establish more ports across the country is entirely up to the government.
“Ports are capital-intensive projects that require funding either from the government or private investors. With private investments, the government must approve the project. Therefore, the decision to develop ports is dependent on the political priorities of the government,” he noted
A case can be made to establish new ports in southeastern Nigeria due to the large scale of economic activities in cities like Onitsha and Aba, Nnadi added.
This, he said, would also ease the congestion at the Lagos ports and reduce the cost of transporting imported items for businesses.
Enock Nyariki, the communication manager at the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), said that despite recent advancements, AI tools still generate false information for users.
“Even with the rapid pace of advancement in the past 24 months, all large language models still generate false information. It’s unlikely that these models will completely stop hallucinating,” Nyariki told AFP Fact Check.
“AI companies can help reduce misinformation harms by supporting media literacy campaigns and partnering with nonpartisan fact-checkers who are combating falsehoods on the frontlines.”

"At 1 am, I was receiving calls of congratulations, and based on the models, it appeared I would win the Senate race. Then at 4 am, Milwaukee reported approximately 108,000 absentee ballots with Senator Baldwin nearly 90 percent of those ballots," Hovde says in a video shared November 12 on X.
"Statistically, this outcome seems improbable."
In the four-and-a-half-minute video, he also claims officials failed to "clean up" voter rolls, saying eight million people are registered to vote in Wisconsin out of a voting-age population of under five million.
Far-right commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who has previously shared misinformation, amplified the claims in a November 11 X post. It includes a line graph showing an uptick in votes for Baldwin just after 1000 GMT, overtaking Hovde's previous lead.
"Another 3am ballot dump in Wisconsin just cost us greatly," D'Souza said. "They're hoping we're too focused on the presidency to care about these other races. Sound the alarm!"
The same claim has circulated elsewhere on X, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, YouTube and Gettr.
With more than 95 percent of votes recorded as of 1500 GMT on November 18, Baldwin had received 49.4 percent of the vote compared to Hovde's 48.5 percent. President-elect Donald Trump also beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the state by around 30,000 votes (archived here).
Hovde conceded his election loss and said he would not ask for a recount in a November 18 X post, but continued to question the validity of Milwaukee's absentee vote count.
Unofficial results from Milwaukee, Wisconsin's largest city, show Baldwin received 80.9 percent of roughly 109,000 absentee votes compared to 80.6 percent for Harris and about 84 percent for President Joe Biden in 2020 (archived here).
The Wisconsin Election Commission has refuted Hovde's claims of wrongdoing, saying in a November 14 statement that the late-night reporting of absentee votes in Milwaukee was "expected" and "communicated to the public before Election Day" (archived here).
"The accusations of large-scale 'ballot dumps' in the middle of the night in cities such as Milwaukee stems from a misunderstanding of how the counting process works following a statewide election," the commission said.
The Milwaukee Election Commission (MEC) has also rubbished Hovde's claims, telling AFP that his "accusations lack any merit" and are "baseless."
"Every aspect of the MEC's operations was conducted with transparency and in strict adherence to established laws and procedures," officials said in a November 13 email.
AFP contacted the Hovde campaign for comment, but no response was forthcoming.
Jerald Podair, a professor of history and American studies at Lawrence University (archived here), said Milwaukee's late reporting of absentee votes is a "usual tradition" in Wisconsin politics and that most candidates know to wait before declaring victory.
He said state law prevents officials from counting absentee ballots before Election Day, often leading to delays (archived here).
"Milwaukee is a big county -- it is not the most efficient place in the world, and so traditionally, they dump their ballots at three in the morning, basically because that's when they're done," he said November 14.
John Johnson, a research fellow at the Marquette Law School Lubar Center for Public Policy Research and Civic Education (archived here), said people who claim there were "irregularities" in the Wisconsin Senate election are "simply lying."
"The number of ballots that are reported at the end of that central count process is public information and known by everyone who's paying attention when the polls close on Election Day," he said November 14.
Local media reported city officials took custody of the final absentee ballot count at about 0924 GMT on November 6, before uploading its results webpage at around 1030 GMT.
Wisconsin is one of many states that allow people to register to vote on Election Day. Officials ask voters for proof of residence and photo IDs before submitting their ballots (archived here).
As a result, some Wisconsin precincts may report more ballots than the number of voters registered before Election Day. But the Wisconsin Election Commission said that is usually because people recently moved to the area and is not evidence of wrongdoing.
"There can never be more voters who cast a ballot in a jurisdiction than there are voters who are registered to vote in that jurisdiction, once a final number of registered voters for that jurisdiction has been calculated," the agency said in a separate November 14 statement, adding that no city wards reported more than 100 percent voter turnout this year (archived here).
Podair of Lawrence University said absentee ballots and votes from same-day registrants in Milwaukee generally favor Democratic candidates, partially because party volunteers hold registration drives almost until the polls close.
"We have to distinguish between hardball politics and illegal politics," he said.
The Wisconsin Election Commission said in a third statement that the state only had about 3.65 million active registered voters as of November 1. Hovde misleadingly claimed around eight million people were on voter rolls (archived here).
Another "inactive" list includes around 4.3 million people, according to the agency -- most of whom have died, moved to another state, been convicted of a felony or are otherwise ineligible to vote.
"Wisconsin does not delete voter records. This means the total number of people on the inactive list will continue to grow over time, as additional voter records are created and deactivated through people's lifespans," the commission said.
Wisconsin law allows statewide candidates to request a recount if the margin of victory is no more than one percent, but they must cover some of the cost of the recount if it is above a quarter of a percent (archived here).
Ryan Weichelt, an elections expert and professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire (archived here), said complaints about Milwaukee's vote count surface in almost "every election" and that recounts rarely change the results.

"4 key swing states red entirely because of third party voters," said a November 5, 2024 post on X.
Since the November 5 election, similar claims -- primarily targeted at Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver -- sought to pin the Democrat's loss in several swing states to third-party votes.
"The lefty degenerates have been threatening to vote third party or not at all for the entire year and *now* they're urging the Biden-Harris administration to 'do something' before Trump takes over? Babes, the election was the time to 'do something' and you opted out. Enjoy!," said another widely shared X post.
But the claims are not supported by available data.
Based on votes counted through November 18, Trump had nearly 3 million more votes than Harris (archived here) -- a still-to-be-certified lead that puts him on course to be the first Republican president in 20 years to win the popular vote.
NBC News reported that third-party votes totaled around 2.7 million (archived here) as of November 18.
"The Republican victory in 2024 cannot be explained by the existence of third parties," Northwestern University's Data Science faculty director Thomas William Miller (archived here) said on November 6.
Atiba Ellis, a professor of law at Case Western Reserve University specializing in voting rights, agreed (archived here).
"President-elect Trump won squarely because he out-performed Vice President Harris with his traditional constituency, white male and white female voters," he said on November 6.
Trump also "improved his performance with Latino voters and made some small gains across other demographics."
AFP examined how both candidates and major third parties scored, in the seven battleground states of the 2024 election, according to preliminary results.
Trump appealed to rural voters to take the win with a margin of some 129,000 votes  (archived here).
Third-party votes, collectively, accounted for about 109,000 votes.
Preliminary results for third parties represented about 39,000 votes -- not nearly enough to make up for the 115,000 vote gap between Trump and Harris (archived here).
Trump also won by a comfortable margin in North Carolina, distancing himself from his Democratic opponent by some 186,000 votes, as preliminary results show.
The rest of the votes in the US presidential race add up to 85,000.
In Nevada, the race was significantly closer with a gap of some 46,000 votes between the two main parties, in favor of Trump, as preliminary results show.
Yet only 28,000 voted for third-party candidates.
Trump won Arizona by 185,000 votes, while third parties accounted for about 36,000, preliminary results showed.
Wisconsin was an exception, with results reported by NBC News showing the Republican candidate won by about 30,000 votes. In this case, it would have been possible for Harris to win the state if she secured a large majority of third-party votes.
Some 50,000 voters in Wisconsin chose third-party candidates, most of them selecting Stein, Oliver or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -- nephew of the assassinated president John F. Kennedy and a long-time conspiracy theorist -- who dropped out of the presidential race in August and endorsed Trump.
Trump won Michigan with a margin of nearly 80,000 votes -- a gap that in theory could have been closed without third-party votes, although Harris would have required nearly all of the 87,000 cast for other candidates.
Speaking to AFP after polls closed in Michigan, Stein pushed back against those branding her a "spoiler."
"This is self-serving propaganda," said Stein at a watch party in Dearborn on November 5. "They're basically trying to blame and shame voters for exercising their values and for participating in the competition that elections are supposed to represent."
Trump swept all seven swing states as he secured the Electoral College victory.
"There were only two states in the nation where the margins between Trump and Harris were close enough such that, if all third-party voters cast ballots for Harris instead, it would have flipped the state: Michigan (worth 15 electoral votes) and Wisconsin (worth 10 electoral votes)," sociologist Musa al-Gharbi said in an analysis (archived here) published on his blog on November 11.
However, even if every non-Trump vote in those two states swung to Harris, it would not change the outcome of the election. Harris needed 270 electoral votes to win the White House but fell far below that at 226.
"Third parties didn't 'spoil' this race for Harris. She lost the race cleanly and decisively -- both at the electoral college and popular vote levels -- with or without third parties," al-Gharbi concluded.
Experts said the Democratic Party failed to convince its electorate to show up at the polls in traditionally liberal strongholds such as Philadelphia and Detroit.
Exit polls showed Trump also got a boost from Latino voters, while Biden had largely beaten him with that part of the electorate four years ago.
Political scientist Larry Sabato (archived here) told AFP on November 6: "Some people wouldn't have voted at all without their preferred choice as an option, others would have (believe it or not) picked Trump or perhaps RFK Jr. -- if he were still on the ballot, as he was in a few states."
AFP has debunked other false and misleading claims about the 2024 election.

The footage shows a group of men in red uniforms rifling through drawers to reveal wads of cash stuffed inside.
"Viral video of Budi Arie's office staff raided by the police, found an amazing amount of money!" read a TikTok post that shared the clip on November 12.
Ten staff from Indonesia's communication and digital affairs ministry -- formerly headed by Budi Arie Setiadi -- were arrested for allegedly accepting bribes from operators of online gambling sites to help them skirt a government ban, police said on November 1 (archived link).
Seven other people have been arrested in the case, as of November 13.
"It's truly crazy that Budi Arie's special staff office was raided by the police and an unbelievable amount of money was found," the TikTok post added, quoting Indonesian politician Ahmad Sahroni.
Sahroni shared the video alongside similar claims on Instagram.
The video racked up more than nine million views in a similar post on TikTok and also spread on YouTube.
The posts prompted a wave of comments from social media users who appeared to believe the video genuinely showed a raid at the ministry.
"Arrest Budi Arie," one wrote.
"Which government can we trust anymore?" another said.
While Indonesian police genuinely searched the communication and digital affairs ministry on November 1, the footage shared on TikTok shows a different operation (archived link).
A keyword search on YouTube found similar footage in a news report from October 3 posted by Indonesian channel Metro TV (archived link).
According to the report, a series of Attorney General's Office raids at the properties of Duta Palma Group, a corporation involved in the palm oil plantation business, led to the seizure of 822 billion Indonesian rupiah (51.8 million dollars).
Metro TV's YouTube video shows the same search operation filmed from a different angle.
The same men in red uniforms -- which bear the logo of Indonesia's Attorney General's Office -- can be seen in both videos, alongside the same drawers full of cash.
Below is comparison of the video shared in false posts (left) and Metro TV's video (centre and right), with similarities highlighted.
The Attorney General's Office subsequently said a further raid on the corporation -- which was suspected of money laundering -- increased the total seized cash to 1.1 trillion rupiah (archived link).
A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office confirmed the video was unrelated to the ministry gambling case.
"The video shows a search conducted by our men in another case, involving investigation into money laundering by a company called Duta Palma," Harli Siregar, the Attorney General Office's spokesperson told AFP on November 13.

"The birth rate among the Malays is 64.7 percent while among the Chinese it is 9.7 percent," read a Malay-language TikTok post from November 1, 2024.
"It's strange that there is a 8 million increase in the number of the Chinese population. Where did so many of them come from?"
The post racked up more than 37,000 views.
A screenshot of the TikTok post spread on Facebook here, here, here and here.
Similar claims about 1.2 million Chinese nationals supposedly acquiring Malaysian citizenship have circulated online since 2022 (archived link).
It was amplified in November by a Muslim preacher who reportedly claimed 1.2 million Chinese nationals were given Malaysian citizenship en masse. Police are now investigating the cleric (archived link).
The resurgence of the claim prompted Malaysia's Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail to rebuff the misleading figures during a parliamentary session on November 7, 2024 (archived link).
He said only 103 Chinese people, not 1.2 million, had been granted Malaysian citizenship since 2013, in accordance with the Malaysian Federal Constitution since 2013.
"Those who were given citizenship were Chinese nationals who are married to locals," the minister said.
Saifuddin said the 1.2 million figure was "untrue". He added that 84,817 Chinese nationals currently remained in Malaysia on social visit passes -- referring to short-term visas issued to tourists (archived link).
Meanwhile, between January 1, 2018 to November 2024, Malaysia saw more than 8.4 million Chinese tourists enter the country -- including 8 million who departed, he said.
The remaining 479,300 included people who stayed in the country for various reasons, including those with long-term visas, special passport applications or those detained by authorities.
Malaysia is a multiracial country of 34 million people, with an ethnic composition of Malays, Chinese, Indians and other races.
Malays and indigenous peoples, collectively known as Bumiputera, make up 70.4 percent of the population, while Chinese account for 22.4 percent and Indians represent 6.5 percent. Other races make up 0.7 percent of the population.
Meanwhile, the birth rate among Malays stands at 67 percent, or 305,400, while the Chinese made up 9.8 percent, or 44,800. The birth rate among Indians was 4.4 percent, or 20,000 (archived link).

The video was shared on November 7, 2024, in an Urdu-language X post that accuses army chief General Syed Asim Munir of disrespecting Pakistani women yet "falling to others' feet when abroad".
The accompanying clip, which was viewed more than 370,000 times, appears to show the army chief reaching over to touch the knee of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Touching someone else's knee is considered an expression of respect in Pakistan;  government officials will sometimes touch the knee of a political opponent or ally to solicit their support (archived link).
The Urdu word "bachalo (save me)" is superimposed in the top-left of the clip, while "Bilal Ai" is written in the top-right.
The video was shared by an account which has previously posted content in support of Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, who fell out with the country's influential military establishment just prior to his ouster in April 2022 (archived link).
The military looms large over Pakistan's political landscape, with generals having run the country for nearly half its history since partition from India in 1947.
The same video was shared alongside similar claims elsewhere on X here, here and here.
It circulated after the Saudi crown prince welcomed the Pakistan army chief at the Royal Palace during an official visit on November 6.
According to the Pakistan military's information wing (ISPR), the two discussed regional peace, defence and security cooperation and strategies for enhancing relations (archived link).
But the footage released by state media of the meeting does not show the supposed interaction circulating on social media.
A keyword search on Google for "Bilal Ai" -- the superimposed text on the falsely shared video -- led to the same clip shared on a TikTok account bearing the same name (archived link).
The account's bio says "AI content" as well as "Satire".
The video was shared on the account on November 7, with the disclaimer: "Creator labelled as AI generated."
According to TikTok, "creators apply this label themselves to indicate that their content was completely generated or significantly edited by AI" (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison between the video used in the false post (left) and the same video labelled as "AI generated" on TikTok (right):
A reverse image search on Google using keyframes from the AI-generated video led to a corresponding photo posted by the Saudi foreign ministry on X (archived link).
The same photo was also used in an article by Geo News and credited to ISPR (archived link).
The Geo News article also includes an embedded video showing footage from the meeting between the army chief and the Saudi crown prince taken from a slightly different angle, but at no point in the brief clip does Munir reach over to touch the knee of Saudi Arabia's de facto leader.
AFP has previously debunked false posts circulating in Pakistan that used AI-generated content here and here.

The video, which was viewed more than 9.5 million times, was shared on Facebook on November 16, 2024, hours before Super Typhoon Man-yi slammed into the Philippines' sparsely populated island province of Catanduanes (archived link).
The clip shows trees being buffeted by violent winds which also dislodge a metal sheet that nearly hits the person filming.
"Super Typhoon Pepito 240 kph," reads superimposed text, using the local name for Man-yi.
The video's Tagalog-language caption read: "Pray for Luzon."
"Catanduanes and (nearby) Camarines Sur are already under Signal No. 5," it added, referring to the national weather service's highest wind warning level.
The clip was also shared alongside similar claims elsewhere on Facebook here, here and here, racking up an additional two million views.
Super Typhoon Man-yi brought maximum wind speeds of 195 kilometres (121 miles) per hour as it made landfall on Catanduanes, the national weather service said, adding that gusts were reaching 325 kilometres an hour.
It was still a super typhoon when it made its second landfall on Luzon, the archipelago's most populous island, on November 17, with the weather service warning of flooding and landslides and huge waves (archived link).
Man-yi was the sixth storm to batter the country in a month; while about 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
The video circulating online, however, does not show Man-yi's impact on the Philippines.
Reverse image searches on Google using keyframes from the falsely shared video led to higher-quality footage posted on TikTok on November 15, 2024 -- the day before Man-yi made landfall on Catanduanes (archived link).
The footage, uploaded by user Arwin Callo, was captioned in a mix of English and Tagalog: "November 1, 2020!! It's been four years (since) Super Typhoon Rolly, but we have not forgotten the trail of destruction you left behind. And now, there's an incoming #TyphonPepito that could possibly reach Super Typhoon Category."
Rolly is the local name of Typhoon Goni, which killed at least 20 people and triggered flash flooding and landslides when it swept across the southern part of Luzon in 2020 (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison of the video used in the false post (left) and the TikTok video (right):
The TikTok user also posted a similar video taken from a slightly different angle on his account a day later (archived link).
The user -- who identified himself as Arwin Cañeza Callo -- said he took the footage as Typhoon Goni struck his home in Malinao in the central Philippines' province of Albay.
Callo sent AFP the original video, and its metadata shows it was taken on the morning of November 1, 2020.
Callo told AFP he only uploaded the footage on November 15 because the approaching super typhoon reminded him of Goni.
"It was the worst. That day, I stepped outside our house because I had to check on the pigs in the pigpen. The wind got so strong, then a large iron roof sheet from the pigpen was already flying," he told AFP on November 17.
"I was lucky. It's a good thing it did not hit me."
AFP has previously debunked misrepresented footage of powerful storms in the Philippines here, here and here.

"In Seoul, South Korea, a massive demonstration involving millions of people unfolds with great intensity. The passionate crowd takes to the streets, their voices echoing through the city," read part of the caption to an X video shared on October 20, 2024.
According to simplified Chinese text overlaid on the video, the protesters are chanting "We don't want to be the second Ukraine!" and "We don't want to be cannon fodder for the United States!"
"The issue of US military presence in South Korea is like a time bomb," the text overlay adds, referring to the approximately 28,500 US troops based in Washington's regional security ally (archived link).
The video, which comprises several clips of marching protesters, was also shared alongside similar claims elsewhere on Weibo and Douyin, where they were viewed hundreds of thousands of times.
The video was shared after North Korea amended its constitution in October 2024 to define the South as a "hostile" country and blew up roads and railways that once connected the two countries (archived link).
Pyongyang's fraying ties with the South has coincided with a stronger relationship with Russia, which has deepened since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Responding to the countries signing of a mutual defence agreement in June, the US State Department told AFP the "deepening cooperation between Russia and the DPRK is a trend that should be of great concern to anyone interested in maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula" (archived link).
The clips circulating online, however, do not show anti-war protests in South Korea.
A keyword search for social media accounts credited at the bottom of the falsely shared video led to the same footage uploaded to Douyin that was described as showing rallies against South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.
The first and last clips in the falsely shared video correspond to footage shared on Douyin on October 15.
"Impeachment procession heading to Yongsan," reads the yellow Korean-language text overlay, referring to the district in Seoul where the presidential office is based.
Below is a screenshot comparison of the falsely shared X video (left) and the video shared on Douyin in October 2024 (right):
Images of the protest -- which took place on September 28 -- were used in local media reports here, here and here (archived links here, here and here).
According to a report published by The Korea Herald newspaper on the same day, thousands of people in Seoul rallied to call for President Yoon's resignation (archived link).
The report said a coalition of left-wing groups blamed Yoon for tensions on the Korean Peninsula and economic strains.
The second clip used in the falsely shared video matches footage uploaded to Douyin on October 5.
Its caption says it shows a "mass demonstration on South Korean streets calling for the president to resign".
Below is a screenshot comparison of the falsely shared X video (left) and the Douyin video shared in October 2024 (right):
Banners seen in the falsely shared clip match up with those seen in a protest held on October 5, and livestreamed on YouTube (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison of the flags and banner shown in the Douyin video (left) and the YouTube livestream (right), with corresponding features highlighted by AFP:
According to local media, protesters had demanded the resignation of President Yoon and for first lady Kim Keon Hee to be investigated by a special prosecutor (archived link).
The rally was held after Yoon vetoed bills passed by the opposition-controlled legislature that called for an independent probe into allegations surrounding the military's investigation into a marine's death during a search mission in July 2023 and a separate investigation into allegations surrounding the first lady (archived link).
The Yonhap News Agency reported that the proposed probes sought to investigate allegations the presidential office and defence officials had "inappropriately interfered" in the military's investigation, and allegations the first lady was involved in manipulating stock prices, had illegally received a luxury bag, and interfered with the ruling party's candidate nominations ahead of a general election earlier in the year.
Slogans chanted during the October 5 march made no mention of Ukraine or the United States.

"An Israeli police officer sat on the body of a Palestinian child and strangled him during protests against (sic) the US embassy in Jerusalem on Saturday. The child suffocated and eventually died," read part of the Thai-language caption to the video shared on Facebook on November 11, 2024.
It shows a man in a fluorescent yellow vest pressing a boy's face to the ground.
The boy is shown lifting his index finger and reciting the Islamic Shahada creed professing belief in Allah and the acceptance of the Prophet Mohammed as God's messenger.

The post surfaced as the war in Gaza raged on, triggered by Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures (archived link).
The militants also took 251 hostages into the Gaza Strip. Some were already killed. Of those, 97 are still held hostage, while 34 are confirmed dead but their bodies remain in Gaza.
Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed more than 43,700 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN considers the figures reliable.
The video was also shared with similar false claims by social media users from Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Australia and Romania.
Comments indicated many users believed the posts.
"I can't stand it anymore with what Israel has been doing to our Palestinian brothers and sisters," one wrote.
"Look at the actions of the most wicked Zionist nation done to the children of Palestine," said another.
There have been frequent protests in Israel following the outbreak of the Gaza war, as Israelis pressured their government to do more to secure the captives' release (archived links).
But AFP found no official reports about a Palestinian child killed by an Israeli police officer during a protest near the US embassy in Jerusalem.
Moreover, the video is unrelated to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and had been previously debunked by AFP after it was circulated with false claims in 2019 and 2023.
A reverse image search on Google using one of the video's keyframes found it was actually filmed in Sweden.
A higher-quality version of the clip was earlier published on YouTube by Swedish newspaper Sydsvenskan on February 9, 2015 (archived link).
Its Swedish-language title translates as: "Guard slammed nine-year-old's head into the ground."
The same newspaper also reported the incident on the same day (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison between the false post (left) and Sydsvenskan's YouTube video from 2015 (right):

An AFP journalist fluent in Swedish analysed the video from Sydsvenskan and found bystanders could be heard speaking in Swedish "That's a child" and "How old is he?"
At the beginning of the video, security guards could be seen wearing fluorescent vests with the Swedish words "Ordnings Vakt" or "public service representative" on the front and back. The uniform is commonly worn by security guards who assist Swedish police.

AFP also contacted Jens Mikkelsen, one of the journalists who reported on the incident for the Sydsvenskan newspaper (archived link).
In an email on November 3, 2023, Mikkelsen confirmed the video was from the incident he wrote stories about and said the incident happened in the Swedish city of Malmö.
"Yes, that is the boy I wrote several stories about," Mikkelsen told AFP.
Mikkelsen referred to the boy as Amin and that he was born and raised in extreme poverty in Morocco before he ran away from home at the age of 12 and ended up in Melilla, a Spanish enclave on the northern coast of Morocco.
"He spent several months each night trying to board a ferry to Spain until he finally succeeded. Together with friends, he travelled by train and bus, then hitchhiked to Sweden," Mikkelsen said.
Another journalist Katia Wagner, who published a book about Amin and other Moroccan boys living on the streets of Stockholm, also reviewed the video (archived links here and here).
Wagner told AFP in an email on November 6, 2023: "That is definitely 'Amin' in that video. I met him after the incident in Malmö, when he was in a shelter, and I stayed in contact with him for a while."
AFP reached out to the Swedish Social Services and the Migration Agency for information about the boy but has not received a response.
The incident was also reported by the France24 outlet on February 11, 2015 which said two private security guards were under police investigation after the incident (archived link).
According to a report from news site The Local Sweden, the two guards did not face charges (archived link).
AFP has repeatedly debunked misinformation related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

"Sephora donated BIG to Trump's campaign… Ulta did not. BlackWomen remember this when you're out shopping, especially this holiday season," says a November 10, 2024 Threads post, citing a rival cosmetics company.
A TikTok video posted the same day claimed multiple companies donated to Trump's campaign and included on-screen text that says: "Sephora BIG BIG BIG DONATIONS!!" It received 1.9 million likes and was reposted to X, where it spurred calls for a boycott of the French-owned beauty retailer.
The claim about Sephora appeared elsewhere on X in posts from women grappling with whether to break up with a favorite brand.
"I love @sephora and I spend thousands of dollars there but after seeing they donated to trump and they're a company who provides services and products for women, it's a smack in the face," one says.
The claim began circulating online after Trump's decisive victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
But the company denied any such contributions, and available documents indicate the claims are false.
"Sephora does not make corporate donations to political candidates," it said in a statement sent to AFP on November 13. The company called the social media claims "incorrect."
The US Federal Election Commission's (FEC) website states that "campaigns may not accept contributions from the treasury funds of corporations, labor organizations or national banks" (archived here).
Corporations can give money to independent groups and political action committees that support or oppose candidates. But Brendan Galvin, the deputy research director for the campaign finance watchdog group Open Secrets, told AFP in a November 14 email that there is "no indication" of this happening with Sephora.
Sephora is owned by French conglomerate LVMH,  which as of November 14, is associated with $78,601 in contributions made in the 2024 election cycle, according to Open Secrets (archived here).
These donations are all individual, defined on the site as "contributions from members, employees or owners of the organizations, and those individuals' immediate family members."
Galvin said: "Donors have to list their employer when giving, and on our site we aggregate that and show the totals by organization."
The Open Secrets figures show that individuals associated with LVMH donated $35,423 to Harris's campaign in 2024, compared to $318 donated to Trump's campaign (archived here). Galvin said there may be additional donations below the disclosure threshold of $200 that would not appear on the site. The total included $616 from LVMH individuals to political action committees.
As for Ulta Beauty, Open Secrets reports nearly equal donations to the two candidates, with $7,973 contributed to Harris and $7,211 to Trump from individuals associated with that company, including employees and owners (archived here).
AFP has fact-checked other boycott calls against companies for purported political donations, and other claims about US politics here.

“Buhari is the first and only Nigerian president to take an IMF loan. He took a $3.4bn loan from the IMF, including several loans from the World Bank. Now, the World Bank is bad, but the World Bank gave developmental loans to Kano and Kaduna,” reads part of an X post that has garnered more than 300 shares since it was published on November 11, 2024.
Likening Nigeria’s economic policies under Tinubu to Malaysia’s reforms two decades ago, the post blames Buhari for lacking the courage to remove petrol subsidies and implement a flexible foreign exchange regime.
The post was shared by an account called “Dr. Toks” with more than 117,000 followers. The account posts regularly about the Nigerian economy.
Buhari, a former military head of state, democratically led Nigeria for eight years from 2015 to 2023, when Tinubu took over from him. Both men are from the All Progressives Congress (APC) political party (archived here).
In 2023 Tinubu declared an end to the petrol subsidy on his first day in office and freed up the naira currency, changes that government officials and analysts say will revive the economy and attract investors.
Meanwhile, the population is suffering the harsh effects of these policies which have set inflation at a three-decade high while the cost of living has soared (archived here).
However, the social media post's claim that Buhari secured an IMF loan in 2020 is misleading.
Nigeria joined the IMF in 1961, and like every other member state, the government is obligated to save funds in a global reserve account called Special Drawing Rights (SDR).
The value of the SDR is based on a basket of the world’s five major currencies – the US dollar, euro, yuan, yen and the UK pound (archived here).
As of 2020, Nigeria had total reserves of SDR 2.4 billion worth about $3.4 billion with the IMF (archived here).
Faced with the need to cushion the severe economic strain caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the collapse in global oil prices, Nigeria requested emergency support from the IMF.
The request was approved on April 28, 2020, under the IMF’s Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) and saw Nigeria draw down on the entire balance in its IMF reserve (archived here).
The RFI is intended to help a country in time of crisis with urgent financial support unencumbered by all the usual conditions of an IMF loan (archived here).
In terms of the arrangement, Nigeria did not take out a conventional loan, although it has been repaying the withdrawn amount with interest. As of October 31, 2024, the country owes SDR 613 million ($838 million).
Before the 2020 withdrawal, Nigeria made four other lending requests to the IMF (in 1987, 1989, 1991 and 2000) but ultimately declined the facilities.
“Since becoming a member of the IMF in 1961, Nigeria has actively engaged with the IMF to address economic challenges and support economic stability,” IMF communication officer Devahasadin Pavis said in an email to AFP Fact Check. “While several financing arrangements were approved over the years, Nigeria only drew on the Rapid Financing Instrument in 2020. Nigeria has also provided resources to the IMF to help support member countries respond to the 1970s oil price shock.”
“Nigeria has entered several Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs) with the IMF; however, no drawdowns were made under these facilities. In 2020, the IMF approved a Covid-19 emergency financing package of SDR 2,454,500,000 (US$3.4 billion) under the Rapid Financing Instrument with a maturity of five years and a grace period of two years; the outstanding balance on the facility is currently SDR 613.62 million (US$838.14 million),” Pavis added.

"Zoran Milanović, President of Croatia, wears a 'Make America Great Again' cap during a press briefing," says a November 7 post sharing the video on X.
Similar posts spread in multiple languages -- including French, Spanish and Portuguese -- across platforms such as X, Facebook and Instagram after Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 contest.
Milanović joined a chorus of world leaders who commented publicly on Trump's victory, offering congratulations in a November 6 Facebook post and saying he believes their two countries will remain on good terms (archived here).
But the politician donning a Trump campaign hat in the video shared online is not the Croatian leader but Dodik, the president of Bosnia's Republika Srpska who was indicted for failing to comply with the rulings of an international envoy overseeing the country's peace accords.
Reverse image searches and a watermark on the clip revealed the footage comes from local television station TOK TV, which posted it November 6 on YouTube and Instagram with captions identifying the man as Dodik (archived here and here).
The station reported Dodik organized a cocktail party at the Republika Srpska Palace in Banja Luka, Bosnia in honor of Trump's win (archived here).
Considered a Kremlin ally and facing tightening US sanctions, Dodik had urged the Serbian diaspora living in the United States to vote for Trump ahead of the election.
On X, he shared additional footage and photos of himself putting on and wearing the "Make America Great Again" hat after Trump won (archived here and here). TOK TV and other media outlets also posted other shots of the scene (archived here and here).
Побједа @realDonaldTrump важна је за Републику Српску. Ово је и наша побједа. pic.twitter.com/ra6wx8su0P
PimEyes, a facial recognition website, matched the face in the video shared online to other portraits of Dodik (archived here).
AFP photos show Milanović is a different man.
Since the end of a civil war that claimed almost 100,000 lives between 1992 and 1995, Bosnia has consisted of two semi-autonomous halves that share a weak central government: the Serbs' Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation.
Under international pressure, major reforms were introduced in the post-war years to strengthen the country's central institutions, to the detriment of the entities. But Dodik has sought to reverse that process and frequently stoked ethnic tensions since coming into power in 2006, even threatening to secede.
Milanović, meanwhile, has condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine while also rejecting the deployment of Croatian soldiers to support Kyiv.

"Defeated cancer, pineapple hot water. Hot pineapple water protects your life. Hot pineapple water destroys cancer cells. Put thinly-sliced  two to three pieces of pineapple into a cup and pour hot water. Drink it daily," read part of the Sinhala-language caption in a post shared on Facebook on September 2.
The post includes the photo of a pineapple farm.
"Dr Gilbert A Kwok of the ICBS hospital has urgently said that if everyone can share 10 copies of this message, at least one life can be saved," the caption further said.
The posts circulated online as Sri Lanka elected leftist Anura Kumara Dissanayake as its new president in September 2024, years after grappling with bankruptcy (archived link).
The South Asian island-nation has run out of dollars to procure vital imports of food and fuel in 2022, triggering weeks of demonstrations that led to the ouster of strongman president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
But it is in the health sector that the consequences of the crisis were most visceral (archived link).
Similar claims were shared elsewhere on Facebook here and here.
The same claim was also shared on instant messaging platform WhatsApp in Sinhala language on October 15, 2024.
"There is no evidence to support any of these claims," Dr Sanjeeva Gunasekara from the National Cancer Institute of Sri Lanka told AFP on November 10, 2024 (archived link).
"Pineapple will kill cancer cell, drinking hot water with pineapple has added benefit, pineapples cure cancer ... dissemination of such claims can mislead general public to not seeking proven therapy which can render curable cancers incurable," he added.
An oncologist previously told AFP that while pineapples contain compounds that have numerous health benefits, there is not enough evidence to show that the fruit would be an effective cancer treatment.
"Like other fruits -- including apples and avocados, among others -- pineapples are healthy. They are fruits that can support general health and immunity. No more than that," chairman of the Indonesian Cancer Foundation Professor Dr Aru Wisaksono Sudoyo told AFP on August 6, 2021 (archived link).
While consuming pineapple and other healthy fruits and vegetables may help reduce the risk of cancer, it is important to note that they are not equivalent to medical treatments or therapies for the disease, he added.
AFP also checked the list of registered public and private medical institutions in Sri Lanka and found no "ICBS Hospital" (archived links here and here).
A keyword search also found no official reports about a "Dr Gilbert A Kwok".
A newsletter from India-based St. Johns Hospital in April 2024 debunked the same claim here (archived link).
AFP has repeatedly debunked misinformation about cancer cures here and here (archived links here and here).

"The Dutch celebrate after teaching the Israelis a lesson they will never forget. Humanity must win. Beautiful solidarity" read the caption alongside the video shared on X on November 9, 2024.
The footage circulated online following instances of violence reported after a Europa League football match between Dutch team Ajax and Israel's Maccabi Tel Aviv, which the hosts won 5-0.
The violence added to the growing list of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic attacks across Europe fuelled by the ongoing Middle East conflict.
The 22-second video shows people clapping and waving a Palestinian flag inside a hall. Some can be heard chanting "Free, free Palestine".
The video was shared with a similar false claim elsewhere on Facebook and X.
AFP reported Amsterdam police made dozens of arrests during what the city's mayor called an "unbearable" night of violence as fans of Israeli football club Maccabi Tel Aviv suffered "hit-and-run" attacks that left five people in hospital (archived link).
The Israeli fans had already had minor scuffles on November 6, one day before the match.
The violence on November 7 started after fans had left the stadium, with what mayor Femke Halsema described as "gangs of guys on scooters" carrying out "hit-and-run" attacks on fans of the Israeli club.
But the video predates the incident by several months.
A reverse image search on Google found the original video shared on the Instagram account of Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza on May 25, 2024 (archived link).
The post's caption read, "Thanks for everyone who attended the worldpressphoto event today. Thank you for being the power I use to continue."
Azaiza was one of the three photographers invited to a panel discussion on "Press Freedom: Navigating a Changing Media Landscape" organised by the World Press Photo Foundation, an independent, non-profit organisation based in Amsterdam on May 25, 2024 (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison of the clip shared in false posts (left) and the Instagram video uploaded on Azaiza's Instagram account (right):
The event was held in the central hall of De Nieuwe Kerk, a church-turned-museum in Amsterdam (archived link).
A spokesperson for De Nieuwe Kerk confirmed to AFP that the video shows the crowd's reaction after Azaiza's talk.
"This video was made after the end of his keynote about press freedom and his personal experience in Gaza. The audience gave him an applause afterwards. That is what you see in the video," she told AFP in an email on November 14.
The visuals in the clip shared in false posts correspond to photos of De Nieuwe Kerk on Google Maps (archived link).

"The ICC rejected the plea to jail Duterte, what now for the loyalists," read part of the Tagalog-language text overlay to a TikTok video, using the popular term for supporters of the Marcos family.
The text below the clip shared on October 21 read: "The ICC junks the appeal of the Marcos govt."
The current and former presidents have had a very public falling out this year. Nonetheless, Marcos has stressed that his government will not cooperate with the ICC investigation into Duterte's drug war.
However, he and his aides also said they would not stand in the way if the ICC asked Interpol to arrest Duterte or if Duterte wanted to surrender to the ICC.
The post circulated as Duterte strongly defended his drug war before a legislative inquiry conducted by the Southeast Asian country's senators (archived link).
Police said the campaign left more than 6,000 people dead, but rights groups estimate tens of thousands of mostly poor men were killed by officers and vigilantes, often without proof they were linked to illegal drugs.
The video was shared elsewhere on TikTok and Facebook here and here.
Comments on the posts indicated some users appeared to wrongly believe Marcos had urged the ICC to jail his predecessor.
"ICC rejects the appeal of the Marcos government to punish Duterte. Marcos admin failed," one said.
"Thank you GOD FOR PROTECTING FPRRD," another said, using an acronym for Duterte.
The original video was published on YouTube by Philippine news site Rappler on July 18, 2023 alongside the title "ICC junks PH gov't appeal, probe into killings under Duterte continues" (archived link).
It shows former ICC judge Marc Perrin de Brichambaut reading out part of the tribunal's decision which rejected the Philippine government's plea for the court to halt its investigation into the drug war (archived links here and here).
The clip came from a longer video of the ruling published on the ICC's YouTube channel on July 18, 2023, in which Judge Perrin de Brichambaut gave the court's judgement from the seven-minute 30-second mark (archived link)
"Before I address the merits of the appeal, I would like to state that it is rejected by the appeal chamber by majority, and the important decision is therefore confirmed," he said.
The footage in the false posts corresponds with the judge's comments at the 23-minute 25-second mark, in which he said: “The majority rejects the fourth ground of appeal in its entirety”.
The Philippines quit the ICC in 2019 on Duterte's instructions, but the tribunal has said it had jurisdiction over killings before the pullout, as well as killings in the southern city of Davao when Duterte was mayor there, years before he became president.
The court announced in 2021 that it would authorise a full investigation into the former president's brutal anti-narcotics campaign (archived here).
In 2022, Duterte's government asked the ICC to defer its probe, saying it was investigating and prosecuting suspects in its own courts (archived link).
The tribunal temporarily suspended its investigation but formally resumed it in January 2023.
Shortly afterwards, the Marcos government filed an appeal against resuming the probe, which the ICC dismissed (archived link).
Philippine broadcaster ABS-CBN has also debunked the claim shared in misleading social media posts.

"I really didn't need more evidence that the 2020 election was stolen, but where did 15 MILLION votes disappear to?" says a November 6, 2024 X post.
The post includes a graph that purports to show voter turnout for Democrats and Republicans in US presidential elections between 2012 and 2024. Democratic participation in the 2020 race appears to be significantly higher than in the other three contests.
The graphic and similar claims of 2020 election interference spread on Facebook, X, Threads and Instagram in multiple languages, including Spanish and French.
The earliest version of the chart appears to have been posted November 6 by Zero Hedge, a conspiratorial website that AFP has fact-checked numerous times.
The graphic shows more than 65 million votes for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to President-elect Donald Trump in 2024, compared to 81 million for Biden in 2020.
The approximate figures for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 elections appear to be accurate, according to data from the nonpartisan poll-tracking website 270toWin (archived here). However, it includes an incomplete vote tally for 2024 -- and the accompanying claims of fraud are baseless.
"It is very premature to compare 2024 turnout to 2020 turnout at this point, we won't know 2024 turnout until all states have finished certifying their votes," said Michael Alvarez, a professor of computational political and social sciences at the California Institute of Technology (archived here), in a November 7 email.
Harris had nearly 73 million votes as of 2000 GMT on November 14, according to the Associated Press (AP), which provides election returns to many US media outlets (archived here).
However, the count is still not final; California had only counted about 87 percent of ballots, and many other US states were at 90 to 99 percent.
California, the most populous state, takes longer than others because of its size and number of voters, mail-in ballots, provisional votes and same-day registration. There were still more than 1.6 million uncounted ballots as of 2000 GMT on November 14 (archived here).
Adam Berinsky, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (archived here), said many of the remaining votes from historically Democratic California would likely be for Harris.
"The Harris popular vote share will go up as things are finalized over the next month (as was the case for Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020)," Berinsky said in a November 8 email.
Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard University (archived here), added that voter turnout can fluctuate between elections.
Data from the University of Florida's Election Lab show about 66 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the 2020 election -- far more than in 2012 and 2016 (archived here). The US Census Bureau has published similar estimates (archived here).
As of November 13, the Election Lab estimated voter turnout for 2024 was around 63.5 percent -- lower than 2020 but higher than 2012 or 2016 (archived here).
The Electoral College certified Biden's 2020 victory, despite claims of irregularities affecting the race -- often egged on by Trump himself (archived here).
Baseless claims that the 2020 election was ridden with fraud and stolen from Trump still resurface online, despite being thoroughly refuted by government officials, courts and audits (archived here, here and here).
"There was no fraud established for 2020," Skocpol said in a November 7 email.
As for the lower turnout among Democrats in 2024, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University (archived here), said the trend could be attributed to general dissatisfaction with the incumbent party rather than vote-rigging in a previous election.
"Some people switched from Democratic to Republican, some other Democrats did not turn out to vote and some additional Republicans came to the polls," Gelman said in a November 7 email.

"Taylor Swift Cancels Red State Shows After MASSIVE RED WAVE, 'I Won't Be Performing Here Anymore,'" says a November 11, 2024 Facebook post.

The claim circulated elsewhere on Facebook, Threads, X and TikTok.
Between her billion-dollar Eras Tour and a high-profile romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, Swift is a widely influential cultural figure -- a position that has also made her a central figure in several conspiracy theories.
Following the September 10 presidential debate, the singer shared an Instagram post publicly endorsing Harris. Swift had been largely silent on the election prior but said she was inspired to speak up after discovering altered and synthetic images falsely showing her endorsing Trump.
Her support for the Democrat sparked a backlash and triggered a wave of erroneous claims suggesting the musician lost brand deals or canceled her tour, but many stemmed from parody. The latest claims, following Trump's decisive victory over Harris, are similarly false.
In November, Swift was nearing the end of her Eras Tour, which kicked off March 17, 2023, and she has no more US concert dates left on her schedule. Her last US show was in Indianapolis on November 3, 2024, two days before the presidential election.
The singer's final stop in her performance series is in Canada, with the show scheduled for Vancouver on December 8 (archived here).
A keyword search uncovered that the claim about canceling shows was shared by The Patriots Network Facebook account, which is labeled as satire. The page's profile includes a written declaimer that says: "The Patriots Network is a Network of Satire and Parody affiliated with SpacexMania.com."
The post itself has several indicators disclosing it as parody, including text in the bottom right corner stating: "This is a 'fictional quote.'"
It also includes a link to a SpaceXmania article, a satire website whose About Us page says: "Our mission? To bring you the freshest fake news, some sassy analysis, and a good dose of satire."
Although some Facebook posts are clearly labeled, others are not -- an example of what the News Literacy Project calls "stolen satire," or "a satirical story that is removed from its original context and presented online without an immediately apparent disclaimer."

On October 24, 2024, a TikTok account shared an audio clip of Odinga speaking at a press conference.
“Listen to Raila Odinga powerful speech today about rejecting AU job to vie for president in 2027,” reads a text overlay on the clip, which has been liked more than 8,700 times.
In the 10-minute recording, Odinga speaks about challenges facing Africa and the need for nations to unite in addressing them.
“There are many things which we will intend to deal with when we go up there. I am a candidate, as I mentioned, and I am happy that the Kenya government has come forward to make me a formal candidate,” he says.
“As you have already been told, we have already submitted our application as required by the AU, the Secretariat. And from now on, it is all systems go.”
The post features a static image of Odinga taken from a television broadcast.
However, at no point in the clip does Odinga declare the end of his bid for the AU chairmanship.
A Google keyword search led us to an official YouTube channel affiliated with Odinga where we found the same speech as the one featured in the TikTok post (archived here).
“Live: Joint Press Briefing on Raila’s AUC chairperson Bid,” reads the caption on the “Azimio TV” YouTube channel.
Azimio is the coalition of parties Odinga represented during elections in 2022 when he lost to President William Ruto in a tight contest.
The joint briefing in Nairobi by Odinga and Kenya’s Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi detailed the opposition leader’s AU chairmanship bid.
Odinga’s speech starts at the 25’20” mark in the original video and matches the audio in the misleading TikTok post word for word.
A screengrab from the YouTube video also shows a match when compared to the image in the false post.
While responding to journalists' questions at the briefing, Odinga said: “I am not going to be very active in Kenyan politics.” He makes no mention of running for president in 2027.
The video was published on August 21, 2024 -- around a week before Kenya officially launched Odinga’s candidacy in Nairobi (archived here).
On November 8, 2024, the veteran politician took his campaign to Ethiopia’s capital (archived here) -- more than two weeks after the false post claimed he had thrown in the towel.
The AU election is set for a secret vote in February 2025 in Addis Ababa (archived here).
Odinga, who hopes to succeed Moussa Faki Mahamat, is one of four candidates, including Djibouti’s Foreign Affairs Minister Mahamoud Ali Youssouf.

"Aurangzeb was our brother who sacrificed for Mother India...he is teaching a new history about the murderer of Hindus. This guy is a disgrace to the name of Hindus," read part of the Hindi-language caption in a Facebook post shared on November 6.
The post included a clip with overlaid text that read "Aurangzeb is my brother - Uddhav Thackeray. It will be remembered while voting."
Aurangzeb was an emperor of the Mughal dynasty, a Muslim empire that ruled most of northern India from the 16th to mid-18th century (archived links here and here).
His name and legacy have been invoked by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other Hindu nationalist politicians before to depict Muslims as oppressors (archived link).
Thackeray can be heard in the clip as saying "He has sacrificed for the country. Now if I say that he was my brother, you will say, 'But do you know the name?' His name was Aurangzeb. He might have been a Muslim by religion. But he sacrificed for his country."
The same video has been shared alongside a similar false claim on Facebook and X.
The post surfaced weeks before the legislative assembly election in the western state of Maharashtra on November 20.
Thackeray's party Shiv Sena (UBT) has teamed up with an opposition bloc that hopes to unseat the state's ruling coalition led by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) (archived link).
Thackeray has claimed that his party -- previously known for its hardline anti-Muslim stance -- now enjoys the support of the Muslim community (archived links here and here).
But a longer version of the footage shows him referring to an Indian soldier killed by militants in Indian-administered Kashmir, not a Muslim emperor.
A reverse image search of keyframes on Google found a longer version of the video published on Thackeray's official Facebook account on February 19, 2023 (archived link).
The post's caption in Marathi read: "Shiv Sena - Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray party head Hon. Mr. Uddhavji Thackeray's discussion session with North Indian people. Andheri - LIVE."
The clip in the false post corresponds to the longer video's 32-minute 18-second mark.
"Our soldier in Kashmir was going home after taking leave to meet his family when the terrorists came to know that he was going alone after taking leave, they kidnapped him in the middle for beheading," he said in the clip.
He went on to say, "A few days later, his mutilated body was found somewhere. Was he ours or not, who had sacrificed for the country? Now if I say that he was my brother, you will say, 'But do you know his name?' His name was Aurangzeb. It would happen, wouldn't it? He might have been a Muslim by religion. But he sacrificed for his country."
"He even gave his life for what is called Mother India. Was he not our brother? He was our brother," he added.
Thackeray was referring to the Indian soldier Aurangzeb who was abducted and killed by militants in the Shopian district in southern Kashmir in July 2018 on his way home to celebrate Eid with his family (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison of the clip shared in the false post (left) and the video from Thackeray's official Facebook account (right):

"Elon Musk used Starlink to hack our elections so he can have nice things while inflicting pain on Americans. Are we really going to turn a blind eye to what happened and let the worst people among us run the country," says a November 10, 2024 post on X.
The post includes a snippet from a local news segment mentioning Starlink -- the satellite-based internet service operated by SpaceX -- in reference to California's Tulare County, where President-elect Trump won approximately 60 percent of the vote.
The earliest post suggesting Musk used Starlink to rig the results came on Election Night, according to NewsGuard, an organization that monitors misinformation.
The claims accelerated in the week that followed Trump's victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, spreading across X and other platforms, such as Threads. In one widely shared video, a woman claims California and several critical swing states used Starlink "to tally up and to count ballot votes."
The allegations echo conspiracy theories about Italian satellites allegedly switching votes in the 2020 election, which officials in Trump's first administration entertained and explored after his loss to President Joe Biden.
Musk, who also owns X, endorsed Trump in July and reportedly spent over $100 million to boost his campaign. On November 12, Trump named him alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new "Department of Government Efficiency" aimed at overhauling the US government.
But online claims that his Starlink satellites tilted the election to Trump are baseless.
"I don't know precisely what they think the mechanism is that could have Starlink interfere with the tabulation of votes, but that would be impossible," said Charles Stewart, an elections systems expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (archived here). "The machines aren't connected to the internet."
David Becker, founder and executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, agreed that an election-changing hack carried out through Starlink would not be possible (archived here).
"We have nearly 10,000 different election jurisdictions, with a large variety of voting machines that are not connected to the internet during voting," Becker said, adding that approximately 97 percent of all US voters made their selections on paper ballots that can be recounted and hand-audited to ensure the machines' accuracy (archived here).
"If anyone tried to interfere with the machines to rig the election, it would be discovered through multiple means," he said. "This, quite simply, did not happen, and could not happen."
Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a November 6 statement that there was "no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure" (archived here).

Elections websites for each of the pivotal swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin say the machines their jurisdictions use to mark and tabulate ballots are not connected to the internet (archived here, here, here, here, here, here and here).
Officials from Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin further confirmed to AFP that they do not use Starlink's satellite-based internet services.
"I've described this particular conspiracy as 100 percent bunk, because it is," said Mike Hassinger, a spokesman for Georgia's secretary of state. "We don't use Starlink and never have."
The state's equipment is air-gapped, meaning it is isolated from external networks, Hassinger said, and there is no evidence of any fraud that affected the result.
Patrick Gannon, public information director for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said his state also has "no evidence of any alteration of votes by anyone."
While each state manages its election infrastructure, federal agencies and experts have for several years recommended that voting machines be isolated from the internet to protect against external threats.
Some states have in the past used modems to help report unofficial results after polls have closed, said Genya Coulter, a senior elections analyst at the nonprofit OSET Institute. And in scattered cases, counties have relied on internet connections to speed up their electronic poll books, which are used to check in voters and ensure people are not voting more than once.
But electronic poll books are different from the machines used to record or tally votes, Coulter told AFP.
"Poll books are not tabulators," she said. "The vast majority of, if not all, ballot marking devices and tabulators are not connected to the internet by any means -- whether WiFi, mobile, or Starlink Satellites. Full stop."
Aaron Thacker, a spokesman for the Arizona secretary of state, told AFP the state's Coconino, Apache and Navajo counties used Starlink systems as part of a pilot program "to support electronic pollbook synchronization."
He said these pollbooks did not collect or count votes. Arizona's elections systems are also air-gapped.
Another jurisdiction that employed Starlink to support its elections infrastructure was California's Tulare County.
Several posts claiming Musk's technologies were used to rig the election cited a local TV news segment in which a reporter told viewers that Michelle Baldwin, the county's registrar of voters, said "access to connectivity was improved this year thanks to Starlink satellite internet" (archived here).
But in a statement to AFP, Baldwin said those details needed clarification.
In California, it is illegal for any part of the voting system to establish an internet connection (archived here).
"To ensure a reliable and stable connection for voter check-in, we utilized Starlink to enhance our internet connection," Baldwin said. "However, I want to emphasize that this connection is strictly for voter check-in purposes only and in no way a part of our voting system."
Baldwin explained that their system is air-gapped and that once votes all votes are tabulated, the results are compiled into electronic files that are securely transferred to the California secretary of state's server.
Stephanie Hill, the county's systems and procedures analyst, provided AFP with a matching statement.
Representatives from Dominion Voting Systems, Election Systems & Software and Hart Intercivic -- three major companies that make election technologies -- also told AFP their systems do not link to the internet.
"Hart has no relationship with Starlink in any way and no Hart voting system can connect to Starlink," a Hart spokesperson said.
Coulter, the OSET Institute expert, noted that Starlink satellites have been deployed for years -- including during other elections, such as the 2022 midterms -- without sparking warnings or concerns.
"It's a highly convenient scapegoat," she said.
AFP contacted Starlink for comment, but no response was forthcoming.

"BREAKING: Hezbollah has officially started striking the Israeli port of Haifa for the first time," says a November 11 X post with thousands of interactions.
The same claim and footage have circulated elsewhere on X, Instagram, TikTok and other websites since June, before the Israel-Hezbollah conflict intensified. Many of the posts credit the Telegram account Middle East Spectator, which published leaked US intelligence documents detailing a potential Israeli attack on Iran in October, prompting an FBI inquiry.
Following Hamas's unprecedented October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, Hezbollah began sporadic cross-border strikes in support of its Palestinian ally.
After nearly a year of war in Gaza, Israel shifted its focus to Lebanon in September 2024, vowing to fight Hezbollah to secure its northern border. The ensuing near-daily exchange of fire forced tens of thousands of people on both sides to flee their homes.
Haifa is on the frontlines of the conflict, with Hezbollah rocket attacks routinely falling in and around the northern port city. Hezbollah militants on November 6 launched a missile barrage at an Israeli naval base northwest of Haifa, but that facility is separate from the one where commercial ships dock.
A keyword search for the name of the ship in the video, the YAF Horizon, reveals the footage was taken in June when the Turkish-owned vessel's engine room caught fire.
In the months before the fire, inspectors in Turkey, Georgia and France cited dozens of fire safety, workplace cleanliness and emergency preparedness-related deficiencies on the YAF Horizon, according to data compiled by Equasis, a service developed by the European Commission and the French Maritime Administration to disseminate public shipping information.
Haifa-based Deputy Assistant Fire Commissioner Moshe Chiko Levy told local media the fire had broken out in the ship's second-floor engine room.
"We're talking about five tons of burning diesel fuel, there is no access for the fire brigade. Currently, there is no one on board, so there is no danger to human life. Right now, the firefighting efforts are focused on trying to save the ship," he told Tel Aviv-based news website Walla! in June.
No major Israeli media outlets covered an explosion on a ship docked in Haifa on November 11.
The maritime tracker Marine Traffic shows YAF Horizon traveled to Yalova, Turkey in July after the fire and had not left port since then as of November 13.
AFP contacted a spokesperson for Israeli police and the company that owns the YAF Horizon, but no responses were forthcoming.

"In case you didn't know, fluoride has been directly linked to many different neurological issues so the fact that the Trump administration is going to remove fluoride from our water supply is a massive deal," says the speaker in a November 5, 2024 Instagram video.
The clip includes a screenshot of a November 2 X post from Kennedy which claimed Donald Trump would back the removal of fluoride from all US water systems due to the purported adverse effects on health.
Over the following days, as election results confirmed Trump as the president-elect, other users on Facebook, Instagram, X and TikTok latched on to Kennedy's claims and reignited longstanding misinformation about the harms of fluoride consumption.
Kennedy spread multiple dubious health theories as he pursued the presidency. He suspended his campaign in August while simultaneously endorsing Trump, which was followed by public speculation about Kennedy's eventual appointment at a federal food or health agency. The president-elect had not formally tapped him for a role at the time of publication on November 13.
Claims about the negative impacts of fluoride consumption have circulated for years, including some fact-checked by AFP.
Researchers continue to examine hypotheses about the potential harms of fluoridated water and have presented studies suggesting that high levels of exposure could lead to health problems. However, the American Dental Association (ADA) maintains community water fluoridation as safe and effective at preventing tooth decay (archived here).
"It's a matter of how much, and if it's just a little, it's not dangerous at all," said Howard Pollick, a professor in the School of Dentistry at the University of California, San Francisco (archived here).
Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral found in rocks, food and water sources (archived here). Pollick, who was previously an ADA fluoride spokesman, said it is used in products such as fertilizer and silicon and therefore could appear in industrial waste.
Known for decreasing the risk of cavities (archived here), fluoride is present in most toothpastes and is added to certain public water systems across the US in an effort to increase widespread resilience to tooth decay (archived here).
The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends an optimal fluoride level between 0.7 and 1.2 milligrams per liter of water (archived here). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported in 2023 that almost every community fluoridated water system observed in the United States measured under 2 milligrams per liter (archived here).
Pollick said that some natural water reserves contain levels of fluoride above the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) secondary standard of 2 milligrams per liter and that nearby residents are advised not to let children drink from these sources (archived here).
A 2024 report from the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) found insufficient data to support claims of negative impacts on children's IQ when fluoridation levels are lower than 0.7 milligrams per liter (archived here). But the review concluded with "moderate confidence" that there is evidence of an association between fluoride levels greater than 1.5 milligrams per liter and lower cognition in children (archived here).
The review did not find any evidence that fluoride exposure had a negative impact on adult cognition.
In September 2024, a federal judge ordered the EPA to take additional measures to regulate fluoride in drinking water (archived here).
While federal agencies such as HHS and EPA make recommendations for fluoride levels in water, fluoridation programs are regulated by local governments.
Higher levels of fluoride exposure -- especially among children -- can lead to dental or skeletal degradation known as fluorosis (archived here).
As is the case for many substances found in the natural environment "there's an optimum level that below which is not good and above which is not good," Pollick said.
According to the American Cancer Society, most of the research examining possible links between fluoride exposure and cancer -- particularly osteosarcoma -- presented "uncertain" or insufficiently strong evidence (archived here). The charity still mentions a need for further research to explore any potential connection.
A 2024 review from researchers in the United Kingdom assessing studies examining fluoride's possible association with bone cancer found that 12 out of 14 included papers did not establish a clear link between the mineral and the disease (archived here).
Globally, fluoride is added to water supplies in an estimated 25 countries. But it is not used in many others, notably in Europe, where public health authorities have expressed concerns about potential health impacts.
Before fluoridated water was introduced as a public health initiative, researchers found communities with higher levels of natural fluoride in their water sources experienced less tooth decay (archived here). More recent research indicates that terminating public fluoridated water programs increases local cavity rates.
Lindsay McLaren, a professor of population and public health at the University of Calgary (archived here), penned a study that found the Alberta city's children were developing more cavities after local authorities stopped fluoridating its drinking water (archived here). She said she was "not convinced" of harm from fluoride beyond fluorosis.
"That can be serious at very high levels," McLaren said. "We're talking way, way higher than the concentration that's used in organized community water fluoridation."
Local media reports Calgary plans to reintroduce fluoride to its drinking water system as community support for the return of the initiative has mounted, but implementation is delayed due to infrastructure complications.

"Now that I am officially serving as minister of finance, today I am making a pledge on my new TikTok account," Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati appears to say in a TikTok video shared on November 1, 2024.
"I will give a gift of 25 million rupiah ($1,580) to those who follow and share this video."
The video circulated after Indonesia's new President Prabowo Subianto announced Sri Mulyani as finance minister in his cabinet, making her the only person to serve as a minister under three administrations (archived link).
The fabricated video of Sri Mulyani offering a cash prize spread across TikTok here and here, racking up more than 200,000 views.
AFP has debunked similar "cash aid" hoaxes misusing clips of Sri Mulyani and other Indonesian politicians, including Prabowo and his predecessor Joko Widodo.
In August 2024, the minister shared a video made by the finance ministry on her official Instagram account, warning viewers of fake accounts under her name (archived here).
But TikTok users left comments indicating they believed Sri Mulyani was indeed giving away cash.
"I hope I get the prize," said one user.
"I'm waiting for the prize," another wrote.
In fact, the finance minister has never made such an offer, said Deni Surjantoro, head of communication and information services for the ministry.
"We assure you that the video is a hoax," he told AFP on November 8, 2024.
Keyword searches on Google led to a video posted on Sri Mulyani's official Facebook page on July 9, 2021, titled: "Webinar Series for Tax Day 2021: Tax Reform In The Digital Age: Challenges and Opportunities (8/7/2021)" (archived here).
In the video, Sri Mulyani said Indonesia needed tax reforms to restore the state budget, which was suffering from low revenues.
"Tax reform is very important and necessary, and we cannot avoid it," she said.
At no point does she mention a cash giveaway.
Sri Mulyani is seen wearing the same outfit and sitting in front of the same background as the clip in the manipulated video.
Below is a screenshot comparison of the manipulated video (left) and the genuine video from Sri Mulyani's Facebook page (right):

"Please answer honestly, what do you need at this moment?" Prabowo appears to say in Indonesian in a Facebook video posted on November 1, 2024.
"School fees, college fees, repaying debts, venture capital or money for home renovation. If you need any of the above, contact me immediately. Inshallah (God willing), I will help you."
Indonesian text on the video reads: "Hopefully, this is beneficial for my beloved people" alongside numbered items for "School fees", "College fees", "Debt repayment", "Venture capital" and "Home renovation".
The post racked up more than 53,000 comments, including droves of messages from people who appeared to believe the video was genuine.
"How can I contact you, Mr President? Honestly, I need money to pay for my son's school, I want him to join the military," one person commented.
Another wrote: "Assalamualaikum (peace be upon you), Mr Prabowo I'd like to ask your help to pay my debts."
The Facebook account that posted the video replied to some comments by asking them to contact a WhatsApp number to "get the gift".
AFP has fact-checked a wave of scams in Indonesia that shared edited videos of politicians apparently promoting giveaways for cash and gifts.
Scam pages typically ask social media users to leave a comment, follow a page or share personal information in exchange for goods or services, with the aim of inflating follower numbers so the page can be sold on and renamed. The scammers may also mine people's data, such as phone numbers and email addresses.
The fabricated video of Prabowo also spread on YouTube here and here.
However, AFP found no official statement from his new administration or media reports about the cash relief handout mentioned in the video, as of November 13.
An analysis found a string of visual clues that indicate the video was made with artificial intelligence.
Prabowo's black hat moves strangely and appears to develop grey shading on the sides during the video.
A brown stain also appears at the bottom of the hat as he speaks.
A watermark at the bottom-right corner of the video reads "HEDRA", which is a platform to create AI videos from a text, image or voice prompt.
Meanwhile, a reverse image search on Google found the original video from which the video appears to have been edited.
Prabowo wore the same dark blue shirt and spoke in front of the same red and white background -- corresponding to the Indonesian national flag -- at his inauguration speech on October 20.
Footage of his address was posted on YouTube by the government cabinet secretary (archived link).
Below is a screengrab comparison of the fabricated video (left) and the original video showing Prabowo's inauguration speech (right):
The president did not mention any cash handouts in his speech.

"20 people, including children, died in a tragic accident as a bus plunged into a gorge at Khagrachari," read a Bengali-language caption in a Facebook post shared on November 5, 2024.
Khagrachari is a city in the southeastern hilly region of Bangladesh that has previously made the headlines for road accidents in June and April this year (archived links here and here).
The post—shared more than 700 times—included four photos of people looking at the wreckage of a damaged bus on a hillside.
Part of the post's caption also read, "The bus had 45 passengers on board. The number of deaths may rise. Many passengers are still stuck inside the bus and an operation is going on to rescue them."
The photos, which AFP found originated in media reports about a bus crash in India, were shared alongside a similar false claim elsewhere on Facebook here and here.
There have been no official reports about such a deadly bus accident in Khagrachari as of November 13, 2024.
Reverse image searches found the photos in different media reports including here and here about an accident on November 4, 2024 in the northwestern Indian state of Uttarakhand (archived links here and here).
Indian news agency ANI published three of the photos here, here and here (archived links here, here and here).
It captioned one of the photos on November 4 with "23 dead as bus falls into gorge in Uttarakhand's Almora. (Photo/ANI)."
The fourth photo was published in a report by the Press Trust of India (PTI) about the same accident (archived here).
Below is a screenshot comparison between the image compilation in the false post (left) and the photos published by ANI and the PTI (right):
A bus in India fell into a deep gorge in Almora district in the northwestern state of Uttarakhand on November 4, killing at least 36 passengers and injuring several others, AFP reported (archived link).
Photos from Uttarakhand's Department of Information and Public Relations also showed a similar scene below:
A journalist in AFP's New Delhi bureau identified Hindi-language text on the vehicle's roof rack -- Gangotri and Yamunotri -- that refer to religious pilgrim sites in Uttarakhand.
District authorities published this list of the accident victims on November 4, 2024 which gave the coordinates of the crash in the Marchula area of Almora district (archived link).
The location in the photos generally corresponds with this roadside in Marchula on Google Street View (archived link).

The false claim was shared on Facebook on November 1, 2024.
"An investigation needs to be carried out immediately. How is this guy still alive?" read the Korean-language text posted above an image of late Seoul mayor Park Won-soon wearing a hat and backpack at a market.
The text below the photo read, "A photo coincidentally taken in a rural marketplace. His body was never even shown to his family".
The overlayed text in the photo read, "Park Won-soon is alive."
Park, who was a three-term mayor of Seoul from 2011 to 2020, was found dead one day after being accused of sexual harassment (archived link).
Seoul police concluded there was no evidence of foul play involved, saying he took his own life (archived link).
Identical claims were shared in over a hundred different Facebook posts, including here, here, here and here.
Comments on the posts indicated some users were misled to believe the image was recent.
"The leftists are always deceiving us. The government should launch a new probe into Park's death immediately," one user wrote.
"No wonder they were so quick to conclude he died at the time, it's all fake," another said.
However, the image has been published in reports and social media posts since 2012.
A reverse image search on Google found a corresponding image published in a report by the South Korean newspaper Maeil Economy on May 3, 2012 (archived link). It attributed the photo to a tweet from the Seoul mayor's spokesperson.
According to the report, the photo was taken when Park inspected markets in Seoul disguised as a foreign tourist to investigate price gouging targeted at foreigners.
"Mayor Park visited sites where price gouging aimed at tourists was frequent, pointed out problems with official crackdowns and ordered the strict application of the maximum punishment allowed by law," the report read.
Below is a screenshot comparison of the false social media posts (left) and the corresponding photo published by Maeil Economy in 2012 (right):
The same photo was also published by the South Korean media outlet NewsEdu, which also carried a different photo of Park posted by the account of the Seoul mayor's spokesperson (archived link).
The image was also posted in multiple forum posts about the mayor published years before his death, including here and here (archived links here and here).
A separate keyword search found another photo of Park at the same market taken by Newsis, also a South Korean media outlet, on May 2, 2012 (archived link).
AFP geolocated the image in the false posts to Seoul's Namdaemun Market, a popular tourist destination in the East Asian country (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison between the Maeil Economy photo (left), the Newsis photo (centre), and Google Street View of the Namdaemun market (right), with matching features marked in red by AFP:
The exterior of the building behind Park is identical in all three photos, while the Newsis photo additionally shows lettering on the building's window that corresponds with Google Street View.
AFP previously debunked a doctored image of Park and former South Korean president Moon Jae-in holding a Japanese flag.

"Sanjay Dutt threatened Lawrence Bishnoi," read the Hindi-language caption of a video shared on X on October 20, 2024.
The video shows the actor saying: "Look Lawrence, what you did to Baba Siddique was wrong. And remember, Salman Khan is like my younger brother, if you harm him in any way, I won't leave you alone. Just remember this."
Another video sharing a similar claim was shared on Facebook on November 2, 2024.
"Lawrence, are you above the law? What you are doing is wrong. And one more thing, stay away from my younger brother Salman. This will be good for you," the clip shows the actor saying.
Both videos show an inset of Dutt, Khan, Bishnoi and Siddique.
The videos circulated online after a former minister of Maharashtra state -- Baba Siddique -- was shot dead in Mumbai on October 12, weeks before elections are to be held in the state (archived link).
Local media reported two suspects arrested after the assassination claimed they were part of a gang run by Lawrence Bishnoi, who is in jail accused of running a crime gang that has carried out multiple killings.
Siddique was considered close to several film stars, including Khan and Dutt.
Khan has received death threats from Bishnoi's gang for years after he killed two blackbucks -- considered by a sect related to the gang to be the reincarnation of their guru -- during a hunting trip in 1998.
The videos were shared with similar claims elsewhere on Facebook here and here.
But the original videos actually show the actor extending festive greetings to his fans and talking about the success of his first Marathi-language film as a producer.
A reverse image search on Google using keyframes found the first video was originally captioned "Happy Diwali", and was posted on Dutt's official Facebook and Instagram accounts on November 7, 2018 (archived links here and here).
Below is a screenshot comparison of the false video (left) and the original video posted on the actor's social media account (right):
"I just wanted to wish you all a very very happy Diwali and a year full of happiness and good health," the actor says in English in the 15-second clip. "Stay fit, stay happy, and enjoy this time with your friends, family and loved ones."
A reverse image search on a keyframe from the second manipulated clip found the original video was shared on Dutt's verified X account on August 8, 2019 (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison of the clip shared in the false posts (left) and the original video (right):
In the 45-second clip, Dutt talks about the success of his first Marathi-language film, Baba. He thanks the media and audience for the wonderful reviews and encourages the public to watch the film.
The actor does not mention the names of Khan, Siddique or Bishnoi in either video.
AFP did not find news reports about Dutt publicly addressing Bishnoi after Siddique's assassination.

"The Indonesian Change Party is officially declared," read an Indonesian-language Facebook post shared on November 1, 2024.
"Come on, all the people of Indonesia, let's join the Indonesian Change Party."
The Facebook post showed a video of Anies posing for photos with a group of people on a stage.
The 55-year-old former Jakarta governor was favourite to win back his old job in regional elections set for November 27.
But he was effectively blocked from entering the race after failing to secure backing from Indonesia's largest political party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) -- which endorsed another candidate weeks before polling day.
The shock setback prompted speculation that the independent Anies would form his own party -- a stepping stone to running for the presidency in 2029.
Anies was tipped as a dark horse in February's presidential election in which he portrayed himself as an anti-establishment candidate, but he lost the top job to ex-general Prabowo Subianto (archived link).
Text overlay on the video read: "This party will defeat the PDIP".
The video was also shared alongside similar claims on TikTok here, here and here that garnered more than one million views in total.
However, Usamah Abdul Aziz, a spokesman for Anies, told AFP on November 11 that the politician had no plans to create his own party.
Furthermore, the video shows Anies at the inauguration ceremony of a youth organisation in October 2019.
The video shows him posing in front of an Indonesian banner that read: "The inauguration of the management of the Indonesian National Youth Committee alumni of the Jakarta branch."
A search for that phrase on Google found the original video posted on YouTube by the Jakarta Provincial Government on November 4, 2019 (archived link).
The YouTube video is titled: "Oct 30, 2019 Governor Anies Baswedan Attends the Inauguration of the Jakarta KNPI Alumni Corps."
The Indonesian National Youth Committee (KNPI) describes itself on its website as an organisation "for gathering Indonesian youth across ethnicities and religions" (archived link).
The people in the video can be seen wearing blue shirts, corresponding to the KNPI's colour.
Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in false posts (left) and the original video (right):
The video in false social media posts about Anies forming his own party can be found from the 16:35 mark of the original footage.
Indonesian newspaper Kompas reported that the KNPI -- established in 1973 -- was linked to former dictator Suharto who ruled Indonesia for three decades until his downfall in 1998 (archived link).

"2,038 suicides have been reported today after @realDonaldTrump election victory," says a November 6, 2024 X post.
An accompanying screenshot attributes the figure to the WHO's suicide prevention program website.

Similar claims circulated elsewhere on X, Facebook and Instagram.
Trump's victory spurred a range of reactions from countries across the globe. However, the WHO did not report a spike in suicides.
"The online claim is not correct," a spokesperson said in a November 8 email.
The resources page for the agency's suicide prevention program does not have a daily suicide tracker or recent figures that support the posts (archived here).
A keyword search revealed the tally appears to come from the website worldometers.info (archived here). Although it cites the WHO, the link redirects to a broken webpage (archived here).
An FAQ section of the Worldometer website says: "For these counters, we show estimated current numbers based on statistics and projections from the most reputable official organizations" (archived here).
However, the site cautions that the numbers are "not expected to be exact to the single digit, but to provide a fairly accurate and informative description of a phenomenon. This inherited limitation must be taken into account for the correct interpretation of the information."
The WHO's most recent available dataset on deaths by suicide is from 2019. The WHO's overall mortality database has not been updated since February 2024 (archived here and here).
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) most recent provisional data, based on death certificates (archived here), is also only available through March 2024.
AFP contacted Worldometer for comment, but a response was not forthcoming.
While the posts incorrectly cite WHO data to promote claims of a suicide spike, two major crisis hotlines did experience surges before and after November 5.
The Trevor Project, which provides free services to LGBTQ youth aged 13 to 24, reported a nearly 700 percent increase in conversations November 6 compared to the weeks prior (archived here).
The Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit that provides free, confidential text-based mental health support and crisis intervention, also told US media it had seen a more than 50 percent increase in conversations from LGBTQ texters starting the Friday before Election Day (archived here).
According to the WHO, more than 720,000 people annually die by suicide worldwide. Estimates based on CDC data show an average of 135 Americans die by suicide each day (archived here).
AFP has debunked other claims about the 2024 US presidential election here.
The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is a hotline for individuals in crisis or for those looking to help someone else. To speak with a trained listener, call 988. Visit 988lifeline.org for crisis chat services or for more information.

"Uh... California? What's going on there, boys and girls?" says a November 6, 2024 X post.
The post includes a screenshot showing Harris received more than 28 million votes, Trump 19 million, and about a million more votes that were divided among Independent, Green Party and Libertarian candidates -- totaling over 48 million votes. The user then compares this to California's estimated population of about 39 million people.
Harris won all 54 electoral votes in California but was defeated by Trump, who won more than half of the 50 US states, including seven key battlegrounds.
The post appears to play into voter fraud allegations that circulated on social media leading up to Election Day -- sowing doubt in the electoral process -- several of which AFP has debunked.
Although the latest Census data estimated California's population was just short of 39 million people in 2023 (archived here), the screenshot is fabricated and shows incorrect vote tallies.
The Decision Desk Headquarters (DDHQ), the data provider used by media organizations reports that as of November 12, with 78 percent of the state vote counted, Harris received approximately 7.7 million votes, compared to Trump's 4.9 million (archived here).
The social media post also displays erroneous figures for other candidates listed on the ballot.
The counting for California is longer than for most states because of its sheer size and number of voters, mail-in ballots, provisional votes, and same-day voter registration. As of November 12, there remained more than two million uncounted ballots -- not nearly enough to account for the totals posted on X.
The California Secretary of State's website and other US media outlets published results that match the DDHQ website statistics (archived here, here and here).
AFP reached out to the DDHQ but a response was not forthcoming.

In the closing weeks of his 2024 campaign, Trump and his allies aired false claims about weather manipulation and government assistance after hurricanes hit North Carolina, a swing state he would ultimately win.
With fewer checks from social media platforms and the struggling traditional media, Trump and his surrogates also complained -- without evidence -- about voter fraud, the 2020 election, the Covid-19 pandemic, vaccine harms and more.
These claims ricocheted across the internet through a network of social media influencers, who in many cases have become news sources for the public as media become increasingly fragmented.
"The problem of misinformation and disinformation is the worst it's ever been," said Bill Adair, a Duke University professor who founded the fact-checking site PolitiFact and authored the 2024 book "Beyond the Big Lie" (archived here).
The tactics designed to contain and correct misinformation, such as fact-checking and social media moderation, "are clearly not working," Adair added.
He predicted few changes ahead from platforms that have largely exempted elected officials from fact-checking "because they don't want to make the politicians mad."
Even as the 2024 campaign was under way, polls found roughly one-third of Americans believed the 2020 election was stolen by Joe Biden.
Misinformation researchers at NewsGuard found 963 websites and 793 social media accounts that have repeatedly published false election information, and 1,283 partisan websites masquerading as neutral news organizations during the campaign.
"The right has invested, since 2016, in building participatory, activist, factional social media networks that are directly tied into its 'small batch' propaganda media ecosystem," said misinformation researcher Renee DiResta (archived here) in a Threads post.
"Things move from one sphere to the next: rumors are picked up by the propaganda machine if useful. Memes shape the messaging... The influencers boost each other."
Ethan Porter, a researcher and professor at George Washington University (archived here), said that while misinformation efforts may not have been decisive in his victory, "Trump was almost certainly helped by Twitter/X's apparent refusal to contain or mitigate pro-Trump misinformation."
The upcoming four more years for Trump have raised concerns of legitimizing misinformation about vaccines, climate change and other health issues given his alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose nonprofit has been a major promoter of false conspiracy theories on Covid-19.
"How are people not alarmed by Trump wanting RFK Jr, a person who has no formal education in health care, in charge of health… this man has promoted anti-vaccine misinformation and public-health conspiracy theories for years," Alma Hernandez, a Democratic member of the Arizona House of Representatives, said on X (archived here).
The Union of Concerned Scientists said the first Trump administration made 1,400 changes to agency websites that removed science-based information on environmental issues such as water pollution, climate change, and endangered species.
"President-elect Trump's path to the White House has been an unprecedented campaign of disinformation, threats, divisive language, and dangerous policy promises. It's understandable to look ahead to the next four years with serious worry," the union's acting president Kim Waddell said in a statement (archived here).
Trump's attacks on the media have also raised alarm bells about coverage of his administration.
Journalist and author Kyle Paoletta wrote that he fears "Trump's assault on the press will become a fusillade of discrete attempts to quash whatever reporting he views as antagonistic" and questions whether reporters will maintain access or face harassment.
In a similar way, social media has retreated in content moderation as misinformation researchers face threats and attacks from conservative lawmakers.
Since taking over Twitter, now known as X, Elon Musk –- who may join Trump's cabinet –- has amplified rather than curbed misinformation.
Matt Gertz of the left-leaning watchdog Media Matters said in a blog post that Trump won over voters thanks in part to "a right-wing media complex that bombards them with falsehoods and grievances while dissuading them from consulting any alternative sources of information, be they legacy news outlets or government officials or medical experts."
Daniel Kreiss, a professor and researcher at the University of North Carolina Center for Information, Technology and Public Life (archived here), said the failure of fact-checking and traditional reporting to stem the spread of misinformation could be "devastating."
"What we're going to see are concerted campaigns to undermine democratic institutions and democratic norms," Kreiss said.

“BREAKING: Passengers in this 18 sitter (sic) bus were reportedly burnt beyond recognition. The driver was reported to have converted his car from petrol consumption to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG),” reads the X post which has been shared over 2,000 times since it was first published on October 26, 2024.
The post also contains photos purportedly showing the shell of the burnt-out vehicle. However, there are no details specifying where the accident happened.
The claim has also been shared here on X and in other posts on Facebook here and here.
Petrol historically has been subsidised by the Nigerian government. But President Bola Tinubu ended the petrol subsidy at his inauguration ceremony in May 2023 (archived here).
This resulted in a more than fivefold increase in the price of petrol (archived here).
To help citizens cope, the government offered discounted rates to car owners to convert their engines to become compatible with using CNG as fuel.
CNG is methane gas that is compressed. It is said to be a safer and cleaner source of fuel with reduced carbon emissions (archived here).
The compressed nature also means that it is lighter than air and disperses quickly into the atmosphere when spilt (archived here).
Safety remains a concern, though, especially after a vehicle converted to run on CNG exploded during refuelling in Edo, a state in Nigeria’s south-south. Authorities said the vehicle was using a substandard kit (archived here).
However, posts claiming to show evidence of a CNG-converted bus that exploded and killed 18 people are false.
A reverse image search of the photos attached to the X post led to a blog post published on October 25, 2024 (archived here).
Information contained in the article shows that the accident occurred in Ebonyi state in southeastern Nigeria.
The article also contained pictures of the accident similar to the ones attached to the false social media posts.
Joshua Ukandu, the police spokesperson in Ebonyi, told AFP Fact Check that the vehicle ran into obstacles on the road placed by a maintenance team renovating bad sections, and burst into flames.
Ukandu said there is no evidence the bus ran on CNG.
“We do not have any formal confirmation of the type of fuel the vehicle used,” he said.
“To also clarify, five people died on the scene and two others died at the hospital so it is false to say all the passengers died in the accident.”
The Presidential CNG Initiative that coordinates the CNG campaign for the Nigerian government also denied the claim that the bus ran on CNG.
There is no evidence that the vehicle ran on CNG.
In a statement published on X, it said no vehicle would explode after having properly fitted CNG engines at the certified centres (archived here).

"Wow, so this is the bridge project built by Father Digong when he was still president," read Tagalog-language text overlaid on a November 5 TikTok video, using former president Duterte's popular nickname.
"Manila to Mindanao," the overlay added, referring to the Philippine capital and its second largest island located south of the archipelago.
The video in the post -- viewed more than 20,000 times -- is composed of four clips showing a six-lane, cable-stayed bridge spanning across the sea.
"Duterte legacy," read the caption of the post, which was shared by a pro-Duterte account.
The video spread across various TikTok accounts that expressed support for the former president.
The powerful Duterte and Marcos families have had a public falling-out as they attempted to shore up their rival support bases and secure key positions ahead of the mid-term elections next year and presidential polls in 2028 (archived link).
They previously allied during the 2022 vote that Marcos won in a landslide with Duterte's daughter Sara Duterte as his vice presidential running mate.
Many TikTok users pointed out there was in fact no bridge linking Manila to any part of Mindanao island -- which is over 1,400 kilometres (910 miles) away (archived link).
However, others appeared to believe the posts.
"People will thank President Ferdinand Marcos but this could not have been constructed if Father Digong did not start it," one commented.
"I thought this was from abroad, but it's actually in the Philippines," another wrote.
The video shared online shows a huge bridge built in China's eastern Zhejiang province years before Duterte took office in 2016.
Reverse image searches of the video shared online found similar footage posted on TikTok on June 19, 2024 captioned "Hangzhou Bay Cross-sea bridge" (archived link).
Below is a screenshot comparison of the video shared in false posts (left) and the TikTok post identifying it as the Hangzhou Bay Bridge (right):
The 36-kilometre (22-mile) Hangzhou Bay Bridge opened in 2008, linking up the financial hub of Shanghai with the booming industrial city of Ningbo (archived link).
AFP confirmed the location of the bridge by comparing it with geotagged and satellite images of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge on Google Maps.
Identical pink fences, white lane markings and street lamps from the first clip match the features seen in a geotagged image taken in May 2023 (archived link).
The second clip -- which shows the bridge descending after crossing the arches -- is a feature shown on the Google Maps imagery of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge (archived link).
Meanwhile, the clip showing a zoomed-out footage of a tower, a circular structure and an A-shaped arch attached to the bridge corresponds to the satellite image of the Chinese bridge on Google Earth (archived link).
The last clip depicting a close-up view of a tower in front of a bridge shows the Hangzhou Bay Lookout Tower, which AFP confirmed using a geotagged image on Google Maps (archived link).
AFP has previously debunked posts misrepresenting photos of bridges from other countries as Philippine infrastructure here, here and here.

The photo was shared on November 1, 2024 on Facebook with a Bengali-language caption that read, "The process of handing over Saint Martin's is over! Alas, the unfortunate nation will cry for the Sheikh's daughter one day!"
It was shared by a former leader of the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party.
After Hasina was toppled, the interim government -- led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus -- banned the Chhatra League, citing its involvement in violent attacks on student protests (archived here).
The photo was also shared on Facebook here and here with a similar misleading claim.
The US State Department rejected in 2023 all allegations it was planning to take over Saint Martin's island after Hasina and her party leaders accused Washington of pressuring Dhaka to lease the territory to turn it into a military base (archived here).
Hasina has subsequently claimed that the United States played a role in her ouster because they want to take over the island -- an accusation that the White House has denied (archived here).
In November this year, both the US and Bangladesh governments have separately refuted that military officials met to discuss the transfer of control over the island.
"This is blatant fake news. Saint Martin’s is an integral part of Bangladesh and is not for lease to any country", said Shafiqul Alam, press advisor to the interim Bangladeshi government that replaced Hasina.
"The meeting was a routine program and seven such meetings were held in previous years", he said.
"These claims are completely false," said Asha Beh, acting press officer at the US Embassy in Dhaka.
There have been no official reports that Bangladesh has ceded the island to the US as of November 12, 2024.
The Bangladesh military said the photo was taken during routine Land Forces Talks (LFT) with 19 of its representatives and a 17-member delegation from the US Army in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka at the end of October.
A reverse image search in Google found the photo here on the website for the Bangladesh defense ministry's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) department (archived here).
It was titled "Successful completion of Bangladesh-United States 8th LAND FORCES TALKS (LFT)-2024".
"The two-day long Bangladesh-United States 8th Land Forces Talks (LFT) 2024 from 30 October to 31 October 2024 concluded today Thursday (31 October 2024) at Army Multipurpose Complex, Dhaka Cantonment," it said.
"The high-level meeting was attended by representatives of the armies of both the countries and fruitful discussions were held on various important issues to enhance mutual cooperation."
The release included the photo alongside the caption, "US delegation leader Major General Scott A. Winter and Brigadier General Humayun Kabir of Bangladesh Army are seen signing on behalf of their countries during the 8th LAND FORCES TALKS-2024."
The Bangladesh interim government, posting on Facebook as Chief Adviser Press Wing Facts, clarified on November 2 that the talks were part of a regular arrangement between the two countries, not a "handing over meeting" for Saint Martin’s island (archived here).
"Land Forces Talks between the Bangladesh Army and the US Army Pacific have continued for several years. The 7th Land Forces Talks was held August 14 – 16, 2023, at Fort Shafter, Hawaii. Any post linking the talks with Saint Martin’s Island is a rumour. The Interim Government has made it clear on multiple occasions that it has no plan to lease out the Island to any foreign country for any purpose."

"#Israeli fighter jets are returning from #Iran after destroying its several air defense systems and military bases," read a Thai-language X post that shared the video on October 27.
The previous day, Israel launched strikes on military sites in Iran, risking further regional escalation more than a year into the Gaza war and a month into the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon (archived link).
The Israeli raid was in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on October 1, itself retaliation for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander.
The video, which shows aircraft flying in formation, made the rounds on social media around the world, including in Arabic, Indonesian and English.
Former US ambassador to Israel David M. Friedman also shared the false claim on his X account.
A reverse image search of the video on Google found it was previously posted on TikTok on October 3 -- more than three weeks before Israel's strikes on Iran (archived link).
The video's Arabic-language caption translates as: "Egyptian army."
Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in false posts (left) and the earlier TikTok video (right):
The TikTok user who posted the video told AFP he filmed it in Al Shourouk, east of the Egyptian capital Cairo, during a military academy graduation ceremony on October 3.
According to Egypt's State Information Service, the Egyptian Military Academy in Cairo held a graduation ceremony that day (archived link).
"The ceremony included impressive aerial displays, with helicopters carrying the Egyptian flag and military emblems, and a formation of 19 aircraft representing the 118th graduating class," it said on its website.
Arabic-speaking AFP journalists confirmed a man heard off-camera in the video was speaking an Egyptian dialect of Arabic, and said: "God bless" as the planes flew by.
A man -- possibly the same person -- is also heard saying "the eagles of the sky" in the same dialect.
Moreover, an Egyptian car license plate is visible in the video, corresponding to those commonly used in the North African country, as shown in the website WorldLicensePlates.com (archived link).
There have been no official reports Israeli forces used Egyptian airspace after launching air strikes against Iran.
Iran's neighbour Iraq condemned Israel's use of its airspace in the attack in a protest letter sent to United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council, Baghdad said (archived link).
AFP has repeatedly debunked misinformation related to the conflict in the Middle East.

"Is he crazy? The criminal who calls the US president a criminal," read a Korean-language Facebook post shared on November 10, 2024.
The post included an image of Lee, the opposition Democratic Party candidate for president in 2022 and its current leader, holding up a placard that appeared to say, "Trump = criminal."
The image was shared days after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election, beating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in a stunning comeback to the White House (archived link).
Trump is currently out on bail in three criminal jurisdictions and fighting gigantic civil penalties for sexual assault and fraud. He also faces sentencing on nearly three dozen felonies related to his 2016 presidential campaign.
While not convicted, Lee was indicted on several criminal charges including making false statements during his 2022 presidential run and a bribery charge related to an alleged transfer of funds to North Korea (archived links here and here).
Lee has argued the charges he faces amount to persecution by a politically-minded prosecution service loyal to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who led the organisation before beating the opposition leader by a razor-thin margin to become president in 2022 (archived link).
Similar posts also shared the doctored image on right-wing user groups on Facebook here and here, as well as on South Korean forums Ilbe and Naver Band.
Comments on the posts indicated several users mistakenly believed the image was genuine.
One user wrote: "This man wants to get himself killed, what a nutjob."
"He's on his way to Guantanamo Bay," another wrote, referring to the US detention facility.
A reverse image search on Google found the original image showing Lee with a sign featured in a report by local internet newspaper Etoday published on October 18, 2021 (archived link).
The original sign read: "Those who took the money = criminals; those who shared the profits = thieves."
Its caption read, "Democratic party candidate and Gyeonggi governor Lee Jae-myung responds to questions by lawmakers of the National Assembly's security and public administration committee during a parliamentary audit hearing of Gyeonggi province held at provincial headquarters on the 18th."
Below is a screenshot comparison between the doctored image shared on Facebook (left) and the original image published by Edaily (right):
According to a Kyunghyang Shinmun report featuring a different photo of Lee with the same sign, he held it in response to accusations by the People Power Party (PPP) that he granted favours to a private developer in a land development scandal which became one of the centrepieces of the 2022 election (archived link).
Lee in turn accused PPP members who allegedly received bribes from the developer of being the real criminals in the case, highlighting that he received no windfalls from the deal, according to Yonhap news agency's transcript of his remarks at the hearing (archived link).
Lee's unedited sign can also be seen clearly in footage of the hearing captured by broadcaster YTN (archived link).
Following Trump's re-election, there have been no official reports of Lee publicly criticising him as of November 11, 2024.
The South Korean opposition leader sent a letter to the US embassy in Seoul congratulating Trump, expressing a desire for "intimate cooperation" between the allies, according to Yonhap (archived link).
In a separate public discussion on the future of the Korean peninsula under a second Trump presidency, Lee described him as a "leader who has a maximised mercantile sense of reality," expressing concern that his leadership style may not align well with Yoon's ideologically driven worldview (archived link).
Lee has been a frequent target of misinformation debunked by AFP here, here, here and here.

"Underneath The Sydney Opera House...," read a Facebok post shared on October 24, 2024.
The post includes an image of the Sydney Opera House in Australia which shows an underground domain with eight floors, including what appears to be a boat dock at the lowest level.
The image spread across X and Facebook in more than a dozen countries, including Australia,  India, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia .
Some social media users appeared to believe the picture genuinely showed the Sydney Opera House.
"I could not even imagine; it is so much deep with so many layers!" one X post wrote.
"That's our beauty icon of Sydney sir," a Facebook user commented.
But the claim is false and the image first appeared in a Facebook group that posts content created with artificial intelligence.
A Sydney Opera House spokeswoman told AFP the image shared online was not authentic.
"The image currently circulating on social media is AI-generated and not an authentic photograph, illustration or depiction of Sydney Opera House, either below or above ground," she said in an email on November 7.
A reverse image search found the picture published on October 6, 2024 by a Facebook account called "Synthograpy Art", which posts AI-generated images of different buildings (archived link).
The account posted similar pictures which purported to show the underneath of iconic landmarks including Central Park in New York and the Hollywood sign in Los Angeles (archived here and here).
Synthography Art said on its website that it has a "robust collection of AI-generated images" (archived link)
Below is a comparison of the false post (left) and the image from the Facebook account of Synthography Art (right):
Google Maps' Street View imagery showed the image in false posts contained different features from the actual Sydney Opera House (archived link).
The opera house does not stand on circular ground and is not immediately surrounded by grass or trees, as the false post image shows.

Australia's AAP, an independent wire service, also debunked the digitally generated image of Sydney Opera House (archived link).

"They reiterated they didn't print it, but here it is," read a Sinhala-language Facebook post from November 2 which shared the image appearing to show a 5,000-rupee bill with Dissanayake's picture and signature.
The post appeared to refer to allegations the central bank printed 100 billion rupees' ($340 million) worth of cash in October, which it rejected as "baseless" (archived link).
A bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has prevented the bankrupt island from printing money (archived link).
Similar Facebook posts shared the image here and here, suggesting Dissanayake's government had flouted the rules to print new banknotes.
The self-avowed Marxist won a landslide in September promising to reverse steep tax hikes, raise public servant salaries and renegotiate the IMF rescue package secured by his predecessor.
Dissanayake had called for better terms, but after two days of talks with an IMF delegation in Colombo, his government said it would honour his predecessor's deal.
The 2023 bailout helped end crippling shortages of food, fuel and medicine and returned the economy to growth, but its austerity measures left millions struggling to make ends meet.
A representative for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka said it "has not printed any currency bearing the portrait or the signature of Anura Kumara Dissanayake".
"This claim is entirely false," they told AFP in an email on November 6.
Sri Lanka's 5,000-rupee bill features two dams -- the Weheragala dam and the Canyon dam -- alongside a butterfly and a bird, according to the central bank's website (archived link).
Dissanayake's Facebook profile photo appears to have been inserted onto a picture of the genuine banknote, covering the bird (archived link).
The fabricated bill also contains several errors.
Dissanayake was elected on September 22 but the date on the banknote is "September 21, 2024" (archived link).
Furthermore, under Sri Lankan law, banknotes are signed by the finance minister -- a post that Dissanayake currently also holds -- but in the note he is referred to as "president" (archived link).
Below is a screenshot with the erroneous date (left) and the "president" label (right) highlighted:
AFP has repeatedly debunked misinformation targeting Dissanayake.

"It is said that over 400 troops died in just 12 seconds of bombing," read a Korean-language Facebook post that shared the footage on November 2, 2024.
The video shows a group of soldiers hit by a cluster of bombs that suddenly rain down from the sky.
Korean text below the image reads: "The devastating state of North Korean forces massacred in just 12 seconds", while Chinese text above the clip says "Rapid concentrated bombing" and "Just 12 seconds".
Seoul's spy agency said on October 18 that North Korea had deployed soldiers to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, with 1,500 special forces already in Russia's Far East undergoing training (archived link).
More troops are likely to be sent soon, the National Intelligence Service said, adding that it estimated the North could send around 12,000 soldiers in total.
North Korea's representative at the United Nations dismissed the claim as "groundless rumours" and said the secretive nation's relationship with Russia was "legitimate and cooperative" (archived link).
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on November 7 Seoul was "not ruling out" the possibility of providing weapons to Ukraine -- a break from its current policy -- after reports suggesting the North's deeper involvement in the conflict (archived link).
The video was shared across various conservative Facebook pages in South Korea by an account that has previously fanned misinformation.
Some Facebook users appeared to believe the footage was genuine.
"These troops have just become poor fodder for Kim Jong Un's ambitions," one user wrote, referring to North Korea's leader.
"How can you watch this and still deny North Korea hasn't become involved in the war in Ukraine?" another wrote.
But the video shows a game about made-up military operations.
A reverse image search on Google found a higher-resolution, uncropped version of the video posted on a verified YouTube account called Cagri Karip on October 2, 2024 (archived link).
The video, which racked up more than two million views, is titled in Turkish: "American A-10C2 Fighter Jet Attacks Canadian Soldiers! | DCS."
DCS refers to Digital Combat Simulator, a digital battlefield game that offers an "authentic and realistic simulation of military aircraft, tanks, ground vehicles and ships possible," according to its website (archived link).
Contacted by AFP, Karip confirmed the video "was indeed created by me using the DCS (Digital Combat Simulator) game engine, and it does not depict any real-life events."
"This simulation represents a fictional military scenario and is not based on any real-world conflict or location," he said on November 7.
Below are screenshot comparisons between the video shared in false Facebook posts (left) and in Karip's YouTube video (right):
The original clip shows different textured resolutions for the ground, trees, human sprites and vehicles, indicating it is a digital creation.
Karip, who regularly posts YouTube videos created using DCS, features a disclaimer on his channel that "none of the videos created here are reminiscent of the truth" and are "created entirely through simulations" (archived link).
AFP previously debunked other videos created using the DCS engine falsely shared as authentic footage of military situations.

The fabricated article -- shared in a Facebook post on October 28, 2024 -- was created under the banner of Hong Kong's South China Morning Post (SCMP) newspaper.
The Malay-language post said people in Malaysia's northern Kedah state and eastern Kelantan state were not "desperate for investment from communist China".
Kedah announced in March that it was poised to receive 50 billion ringgit ($1.1 billion) worth of investment from eight Chinese companies (archived link).
"China is considering to pull out their investment in Kedah", read the purported article's headline, above an image of Chinese President Xi Jinping and officials inspecting military equipment.
The text below the image read: "Beijing: Following an altercation involving the incident of China flag in Malaysia, Xi Jinping is reportedly calling several companies for a meeting."
The same image was also shared on Facebook here, here, and here, as well as on X and WhatsApp.
It surfaced after Chinese nationals attending a festival in Malaysia's northwest Perak state on October 24 waved China's national flag at the event, triggering a backlash from Malay nationalists who are opposed to what they see as growing Chinese influence in the Southeast Asian country (archived links here and here).
China has been Malaysia's biggest trading partner for the past 15 years, and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has sought a close and constructive relationship with Beijing (archived link). Anwar visited China in early November to further boost economic ties, his third trip since taking office in 2022.
However, SCMP told AFP on October 31 that the circulating image was a "fake news story imitating" the publication.
It had not published any such article about China pulling investments from Malaysia as of November 11, 2024.
A reverse image search on Google led to the same image of Xi published in other SCMP articles (here and here), which credited it to state broadcaster CCTV (archived links here and here).
However, the layout of these articles differed from the purported report that circulated online.
The font, placement and alignment of the headline and standfirst in the doctored report did not match the layout of the articles on the SCMP website.
Below is a screenshot comparison between the falsely shared report (left) and an article on the SCMP's homepage (right):
