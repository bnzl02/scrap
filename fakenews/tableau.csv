The Daily Wire,dailywire.com,,"Published multiple false claims that were debunked by Snopes. Per the Daily Beast, Mike Adams would repeatedly post to the site  ""to attack and mock... students, staff, and faculty"" at University of North Carolina Wilmington.[267] Identified by the Center for Countering Digital Hate as a major distributor of climate change denialism. In 2022, the Global Disinformation Index described the Daily Wire as having a high risk of disinformation due to ""bias"", ""sensational language"" and ""a high degree of sensational visuals"".[268] Alongside Ken Paxton and The Federalist, filed a lawsuit in 2023 against the United States Department of State, partially as a result of this assessment by the GDI, alleging censorship of right-wing media and revenue loss.",,,,,,,,,,
